Release Notes

HDDM 0.5
========

* New and improved HDDM model with the following changes:
    * Priors: by default model will use informative priors
      (see http://ski.clps.brown.edu/hddm_docs/methods.html#hierarchical-drift-diffusion-models-used-in-hddm)
      If you want uninformative priors, set ``informative=False``.
    * Sampling: This model uses slice sampling which leads to faster
      convergence while being slower to generate an individual
      sample. In our experiments, burnin of 20 is often good enough.
    * Inter-trial variablity parameters are only estimated at the
      group level, not for individual subjects.
    * The old model has been renamed to ``HDDMTransformed``.
    * HDDMRegression and HDDMStimCoding are also using this model.
* HDDMRegression takes patsy model specification strings. See
  http://ski.clps.brown.edu/hddm_docs/howto.html#estimate-a-regression-model
  and
  http://ski.clps.brown.edu/hddm_docs/tutorial_regression_stimcoding.html#chap-tutorial-hddm-regression
* Improved online documentation at
  http://ski.clps.brown.edu/hddm_docs
* A new HDDM demo at http://ski.clps.brown.edu/hddm_docs/demo.html
* Ratcliff's quantile optimization method for single subjects and
  groups using the ``.optimize()`` method
* Maximum likelihood optimization.
* Many bugfixes and better test coverage.
* hddm_fit.py command line utility is depracated.

HDDM 0.4.1
==========

* Models are now pickable.
  (This means they can be loaded and saved.
  Critically, it is now also trivial to run multiple
  models in parallel that way.)

HDDM 0.4
========

License
-------

HDDM 0.4 is now distributed under the simplified BSD license (see the
LICENSE file) instead of GPLv3.

New features
------------

* Handling of outliers via mixture model.
  http://ski.clps.brown.edu/hddm_docs/howto.html#deal-with-outliers
* New model HDDMRegression to allow estimation of trial-by-trial
  regressions with a covariate.
  http://ski.clps.brown.edu/hddm_docs/howto.html#estimate-a-regression-model
* New model HDDMStimulusCoding.
  http://ski.clps.brown.edu/hddm_docs/howto.html#code-subject-responses
* New model HLBA -- a hierarchical Linear Ballistic Accumulator model (hddm.HLBA).
* Posterior predictive quantile plots (see model.plot_posterior_quantiles()).

Bugfixes
--------

* model.load_db() is working again.


HDDM 0.3.1
==========

* Fixed annoying bug that broke plotting of posterior predictive.

HDDM 0.3 (6 Sep 2012)
======================

* Complete rewrite of the underlying model creation engine (kabuki) to
  allow for more flexible model creation including transforms. This
  enabled development of a new HDDM default model without explicit
  parameter bounds.
* Group mean distributions are now Gibbs sampled and group variability
  distributions are now slice sampled leading to much improved
  convergence and mixing.
* MAP approximation of hierarchical models for better initialization.
* Improved documentation (check out the `How-to`_ section).
* Chi-square fitting using the Ratcliff quantile method.
* Posterior predictive checks.

HDDM 0.2 (First publicly announced release)
===========================================

* Better model initialization that shouldn't fail.
* Many bugfixes.
* Major internal overhaul.

HDDM 0.1 (20 July 2011) (Semi-private MathPsych release)
========================================================

* Flexible HDDM model class to fit group and subject models.
* Heavily optimized cython likelihoods.
