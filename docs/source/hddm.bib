  abstract = {To make an antisaccade away from a stimulus, one must also suppress
	the more reflexive prosaccade to the stimulus. Whether this inhibition
	is diffuse or specific for saccade direction is not known. We used
	a paradigm examining inter-trial carry-over effects. Twelve subjects
	performed sequences of four identical antisaccades followed by sequences
	of four prosaccades randomly directed at the location of the antisaccade
	stimulus, the location of the antisaccade goal, or neutral locations.
	We found two types of persistent antisaccade-related inhibition.
	First, prosaccades in any direction were delayed only in the first
	trial after the antisaccades. Second, prosaccades to the location
	of the antisaccade stimulus were delayed more than all other prosaccades,
	and this persisted from the first to the fourth subsequent trial.
	These findings are consistent with both a transient global inhibition
	and a more sustained focal inhibition specific for the location of
	the antisaccade stimulus.},

  abstract = {This study addresses the relationship between trait impulsivity and
	inhibitory control, two features known to be impaired in a number
	of psychiatric conditions. While impulsivity is often measured using
	psychometric self-report questionnaires, the inhibition of inappropriate,
	impulsive motor responses is typically measured using experimental
	laboratory tasks. It remains unclear, however, whether psychometrically
	assessed impulsivity and experimentally operationalized inhibitory
	performance are related to each other. Therefore, we investigated
	the relationship between these two traits in a large sample using
	correlative and latent variable analysis. A total of 504 healthy
	individuals completed the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11) and
	a battery of four prepotent response inhibition paradigms: the antisaccade,
	Stroop, stop-signal, and go/no-go tasks. We found significant associations
	of BIS impulsivity with commission errors on the go/no-go task and
	directional errors on the antisaccade task, over and above effects
	of age, gender, and intelligence. Latent variable analysis (a) supported
	the idea that all four inhibitory measures load on the same underlying
	construct termed "prepotent response inhibition" and (b) revealed
	that 12\% of variance of the prepotent response inhibition construct
	could be explained by BIS impulsivity. Overall, the magnitude of
	associations observed was small, indicating that while a portion
	of variance in prepotent response inhibition can be explained by
	psychometric trait impulsivity, the majority of variance remains
	unexplained. Thus, these findings suggest that prepotent response
	inhibition paradigms can account for psychometric trait impulsivity
	only to a limited extent. Implications for studies of patient populations
	with symptoms of impulsivity are discussed.},

  abstract = {Neuronal activities were recorded in the supplementary eye field (SEF)
	of 3 macaque monkeys trained to perform antisaccades pseudorandomly
	interleaved with prosaccades, as instructed by the shape of a central
	fixation point. The prosaccade goal was indicated by a peripheral
	stimulus flashed anywhere on the screen, whereas the antisaccade
	goal was an unmarked site diametrically opposite the flashed stimulus.
	The visual cue was given immediately after the instruction cue disappeared
	in the immediate-saccade task, or during the instruction period in
	the delayed-saccade task. The instruction cue offset was the saccade
	gosignal. Here we focus on 92 task-related neurons: visual, eye-movement,
	and instruction/fixation neurons. We found that 73\% of SEF eye-movement-related
	neurons fired significantly more before anti-saccades than prosaccades.
	This finding was analyzed at 3 levels: population, single neuron,
	and individual trial. On individual antisaccade trials, 40 ms before
	saccade, the firing rate of eye-movement-related neurons was highly
	predictive of successful performance. A similar analysis of visual
	responses (40 ms astride the peak) gave less-coherent results. Fixation
	neurons, activated during the initial instruction period (i.e., after
	the instruction cue but before the stimulus) always fired more on
	antisaccade than on prosaccade trials. This trend, however, was statistically
	significant for only half of these neurons. We conclude that the
	SEF is critically involved in the production of antisaccades.},

  abstract = {The antisaccade task requires a subject to make a saccade to an unmarked
	location opposite to a flashed stimulus. This task was originally
	designed to study saccades made to a goal specified by instructions.
	Interest for this paradigm surged after the discovery that frontal
	lobe lesions specifically and severely affect human performance of
	antisaccades while prosaccades (i.e., saccades directed to the visual
	stimulus) are facilitated. Training monkeys to perform antisaccades
	was rarely attempted in the past, and this study is the first one
	that describes in detail the properties of such antisaccades compared
	with randomly intermingled prosaccades of varying amplitude in all
	directions. Such randomization was found essential to force the monkeys
	to use the instruction cue (pro- or anti-) and the location cue (peripheral
	stimulus) provided within a trial rather than to direct their saccades
	to the location of past rewards. Each trial began with the onset
	of a central fixation target that conveyed by its shape the instruction
	to make a pro- or an antisaccade to a subsequent peripheral stimulus.
	In one version of the task, the monkey was allowed to make an immediate
	saccade to the goal; in a second version, the saccade had to wait
	for a go signal. Analyses of the accuracy, velocity, and latency
	of antisaccades compared with prosaccades were performed on a sample
	of 7,430 pro-/antisaccades in the "immediate saccade" task (delayed
	saccades suffering from known distortions). Error rates fluctuated
	approximately 25\%. Results were the same for the two monkeys with
	respect to accuracy and velocity, but they differed in terms of reaction
	time. Both monkeys generated antisaccades to stimuli in all directions,
	at various eccentricities, but antisaccades were significantly less
	accurate and slower than prosaccades elicited by the same stimuli.
	Interestingly, saccades to the stimulus could be followed by appropriate
	antisaccades with no intersaccadic interval. Such instances are here
	referred to as "turnaround saccades." Because they occurred sometimes
	with a long latency, turnaround saccades did not simply reflect the
	cancellation of an early foveation reflex. Consistent with human
	data, latencies of one monkey were longer for antisaccades than for
	prosaccades, but the reverse was true for the other monkey who was
	trained differently. In summary, this study demonstrates the feasibility
	of providing a subhuman primate model of antisaccade performance,
	but at the same time it suggests some irreducible differences between
	human and monkey performance.},

  abstract = {We propose here that the modular organization of the striatum reflects
	a context-sensitive modular learning architecture in which clustered
	striosome-matrisome domains participate in modular reinforcement
	learning (RL). Based on anatomical and physiological evidence, it
	has been suggested that the modular organization of the striatum
	could represent a learning architecture. There is not, however, a
	coherent view of how such a learning architecture could relate to
	the organization of striatal outputs into the direct and indirect
	pathways of the basal ganglia, nor a clear formulation of how such
	a modular architecture relates to the RL functions attributed to
	the striatum. Here, we hypothesize that striosome-matrisome modules
	not only learn to bias behavior toward specific actions, as in standard
	RL, but also learn to assess their own relevance to the environmental
	context and modulate their own learning and activity on this basis.
	We further hypothesize that the contextual relevance or "responsibility"
	of modules is determined by errors in predictions of environmental
	features and that such responsibility is assigned by striosomes and
	conveyed to matrisomes via local circuit interneurons. To examine
	these hypotheses and to identify the general requirements for realizing
	this architecture in the nervous system, we developed a simple modular
	RL model. We then constructed a network model of basal ganglia circuitry
	that includes these modules and the direct and indirect pathways.
	Based on simple assumptions, this model suggests that while the direct
	pathway may promote actions based on striatal action values, the
	indirect pathway may act as a gating network that facilitates or
	suppresses behavioral modules on the basis of striatal responsibility
	signals. Our modeling functionally unites the modular compartmental
	organization of the striatum with the direct-indirect pathway divisions
	of the basal ganglia, a step that we suggest will have important
	clinical implications.},

	task switching compares with novelty-induced behavioral distraction.
	Here we explore the hypothesis that intentional task switching and
	attentional capture by a novel distracter both activate a common
	neural network involved in processing contextual novelty [Barcelo,
	F., Peri\'{a}\~{n}ez, J. A., \& Knight, R. T. Think differently:
	A brain orienting response to task novelty. NeuroReport, 13, 1887-1892,
	2002.]. Event-related potentials were recorded in two task-cueing
	paradigms while 16 subjects sorted cards following either two (color
	or shape; two-task condition) or three (color, shape, or number;
	three-task condition) rules of action. Each card was preceded by
	a familiar tone cueing the subject either to switch or to repeat
	the previous rule. Novel sound distracters were interspersed in one
	of two blocks of trials in each condition. Both novel sounds and
	task-switch cues impaired responses to the following visual target.
	Novel sounds elicited novelty P3 potentials with their usual peak
	latency and frontal-central scalp distribution. Familiar tonal switch
	cues in the three- and two-task conditions elicited brain potentials
	with a similar latency and morphology as the novelty P3, but with
	relatively smaller amplitudes over frontal scalp regions. Covariance
	and principal component analyses revealed a sustained frontal negative
	potential that was distorting concurrent novelty P3 activity to the
	tonal switch cues. When this frontal negativity was statistically
	removed, P3 potentials to novel sounds and task-switch cues showed
	similar scalp topographies. The degree of activation in the novelty
	P3 network seemed to be a function of the information (entropy) conveyed
	by the eliciting stimulus for response selection, over and above
	its relative novelty, probability of occurrence, task relevance,
	or feedback value. We conclude that novelty P3 reflects transient
	activation in a neural network involved in updating task set information
	for goal-directed action selection and might thus constitute one
	key element in a central bottleneck for attentional control.},

	cases and 88 controls had a range of eye movements recorded; the
	predictive validity of the tests was then examined on eye-movement
	data from 34 9-month retest cases and controls, and from 36 novel
	schizophrenia cases and 52 control subjects. Eye movements were recorded
	during smooth pursuit, fixation stability, and free-viewing tasks.
	Group differences on performance measures were examined by univariate
	and multivariate analyses. Model fitting was used to compare regression,
	boosted tree, and probabilistic neural network approaches. RESULTS:
	As a group, schizophrenia cases differed from control subjects on
	almost all eye-movement tests, including horizontal and Lissajous
	pursuit, visual scanpath, and fixation stability; fixation dispersal
	during free viewing was the best single discriminator. Effects were
	stable over time, and independent of sex, medication, or cigarette
	smoking. A boosted tree model achieved perfect separation of the
	88 training cases from 88 control subjects; its predictive validity
	on retest assessments and novel cases and control subjects was 87.8\%.
	However, when we examined the whole data set of 298 assessments,
	a cross-validated probabilistic neural network model was superior
	and could discriminate all cases from controls with near perfect
	accuracy at 98.3\%. CONCLUSIONS: Simple viewing patterns can detect
	eye-movement abnormalities that can discriminate schizophrenia cases
	from control subjects with exceptional accuracy.},

	with Parkinson's syndrome and Huntington's chorea is reported. In
	the former group of patients, 69 brains were examined morphologically
	and 28 biochemically; in the latter group, 4 brains were examined
	morphologically and 14 biochemically. The results were as follows:
	(1) The main morphological alteration common to all forms of Parkinsonism
	was damage to the substantia nigra with a loss of the melanin-containing
	nerve cells in the zona compacta; the degree and pattern of this
	cell loss varied in a manner characteristic of the different forms
	of Parkinsonism. (2) Neurochemically, Parkinson's syndrome was characterized
	by a decrease in the concentrations of dopamine (DA) and its metabolite
	homovanillic acid (HVA) in the striatum (caudate nucleus and putamen)
	and pallidum. (3) A satisfactory positive correlation could be established
	between the degree of cell loss in the zona compacta of the substantia
	nigra and the disturbance of DA metabolism in the nuclei of the basal
	ganglia. (4) The nosological classification of Parkinson's syndrome
	(based on clinical and morphological criteria) into 3 main groups,
	viz. postencephalitic, idiopathic and “arteriosclerotic”-senile,
	was supported by distinct, though not in all cases statistically
	significant, differences in the degree of disturbance of striatal
	DA metabolism. (5) In general, mild Parkinsonism, just manifest clinically,
	was associated with a disproportionately high degree of striatal
	DA deficiency. From this it was concluded that: (a) clinically manifest
	Parkinsonism represents the late, “decompensated”, stage of a
	disease characterized by a progressive striatal DA deficiency; and
	(b) the striatum can compensate functionally for lower degrees of
	DA deficiency. (6) Positive correlations could be established, within
	a certain range, between the severity of individual Parkinsonian
	symptoms (especially akinesia and tremor) and (a) the degree, and
	also the site, of the disturbance of DA metabolism within the nuclei
	of the basal ganglia; and (b) the sensitivity of the patients to
	levodopa's acute anti-akinesia effect. The latter observation was
	interpreted as suggesting that in Parkinsonism there exists a supersensitivity
	(probably of the “denervation type”) of striatal receptors to
	DA. (7) Based on the correlations, levodopa therapy can be regarded
	as a specific, though probably predominantly symptomatic, treatment
	of the main extrapyramidal symptoms of Parkinson's syndrome. (8)
	In Huntington's chorea the concentrations of DA and HVA in the putamen,
	pallidum and substantia nigra showed no significant deviation from
	control values; however in the caudate nucleus there was a small
	but statistically significant reduction in the levels of these compounds
	(9). The possible functional significance of the observed correlations
	for the pathophysiology of disorders of the basal ganglia such as
	the diseases of Parkinson and Huntington is discussed.},

  abstract = {Habituation, where a response is reduced when exposed to a continuous
	stimulus is one of the simplest forms of non-associative learning
	and has been shown in a number of organisms from sea slugs to rodents.
	However, very little has been reported in the zebrafish, a model
	that is gaining popularity for high-throughput compound screens.
	Furthermore, since most of the studies involving learning and memory
	in zebrafish have been conducted in adults, we sought to determine
	if zebrafish larvae could display non-associative learning and whether
	it could be modulated by compounds identified in previous rodent
	studies. We demonstrated that zebrafish larvae (7 days post fertilization)
	exhibit iterative reduction in a startle response to a series of
	acoustic stimuli. Furthermore, this reduction satisfied criteria
	for habituation: spontaneous recovery, more rapid reductions in startle
	to shorter intertrial intervals and dishabituation. We then investigated
	the pathways mediating this behavior using established compounds
	in learning and memory. Administration of rolipram (PDE4 inhibitor),
	donepezil (acetylcholinesterase inhibitor), and memantine (N-methyl-D-aspartic
	acid (NMDA) receptor antagonist) all increased the acoustic startle

  abstract = {Control adjustments are necessary to balance competing cognitive demands.
	One task that is well-suited to explore control adjustments is the
	stop-signal paradigm, in which subjects must balance initiation and
	inhibition. One common adjustment in the stop-signal paradigm is
	post-stop-signal slowing. Existing models of sequential adjustments
	in the stop-signal paradigm suggest that post-stop-signal slowing
	may be based solely on the events of the previous trial, suggesting
	that post-stop-signal slowing is a reflexive byproduct of a stop
	signal. Alternatively, post-stop-signal slowing could be the result
	of implicit learning or strategic adjustment. The authors report
	three experiments that manipulated the probability of stop trial
	repetition and found that these contingencies eliminate, reverse,
	or greatly increase post-stop-signal slowing. When the contingency
	was not instructed or cued, modest adjustments of post-stop-signal
	slowing occurred, suggesting implicit learning. When the contingency
	was cued, performance adjustments occurred on the next trial, suggesting
	that strategies dominated post-stop-signal slowing. These results
	show that post-stop-signal slowing is not a reflexive byproduct of
	the stop signal. The large changes in strategy accompany large changes
	in task factors, suggesting that the modest post-stop-signal slowing
	usually observed may be a result of the relatively static task environment
	that does not encourage large strategic changes. (PsycINFO Database

	Evidence from diverse experimental approaches has linked this function
	to a mostly right-lateralized network of cortical and subcortical
	areas, wherein a signal from the frontal cortex to the basal ganglia
	is believed to trigger motor-response cancellation. Recently, however,
	it has been recognized that in the context of typical motor-control
	paradigms those processes related to actual response inhibition and
	those related to the attentional processing of the relevant stimuli
	are highly interrelated and thus difficult to distinguish. Here,
	we used fMRI and a modified Stop-signal task to specifically examine
	the role of perceptual and attentional processes triggered by the
	different stimuli in such tasks, thus seeking to further distinguish
	other cognitive processes that may precede or otherwise accompany
	the implementation of response inhibition. In order to establish
	which brain areas respond to sensory stimulation differences by rare
	Stop-stimuli, as well as to the associated attentional capture that
	these may trigger irrespective of their task-relevance, we compared
	brain activity evoked by Stop-trials to that evoked by Go-trials
	in task blocks where Stop-stimuli were to be ignored. In addition,
	region-of-interest analyses comparing the responses to these task-irrelevant
	Stop-trials, with those to typical relevant Stop-trials, identified
	separable activity profiles as a function of the task-relevance of
	the Stop-signal. While occipital areas were mostly blind to the task-relevance
	of Stop-stimuli, activity in temporo-parietal areas dissociated between
	task-irrelevant and task-relevant ones. Activity profiles in frontal
	areas, in turn, were activated mainly by task-relevant Stop-trials,
	presumably reflecting a combination of triggered top-down attentional
	influences and inhibitory motor-control processes.},

	has shed light on the neural bases of learning from rewards and punishments.
	One fundamental problem in reinforcement learning is the credit assignment
	problem, or how to properly assign credit to actions that lead to
	reward or punishment following a delay. Temporal difference learning
	solves this problem, but its efficiency can be significantly improved
	by the addition of eligibility traces (ET). In essence, ETs function
	as decaying memories of previous choices that are used to scale synaptic
	weight changes. It has been shown in theoretical studies that ETs
	spanning a number of actions may improve the performance of reinforcement
	learning. However, it remains an open question whether including
	ETs that persist over sequences of actions allows reinforcement learning
	models to better fit empirical data regarding the behaviors of humans
	and other animals. Here, we report an experiment in which human subjects
	performed a sequential economic decision game in which the long-term
	optimal strategy differed from the strategy that leads to the greatest
	short-term return. We demonstrate that human subjects' performance
	in the task is significantly affected by the time between choices
	in a surprising and seemingly counterintuitive way. However, this
	behavior is naturally explained by a temporal difference learning
	model which includes ETs persisting across actions. Furthermore,
	we review recent findings that suggest that short-term synaptic plasticity
	in dopamine neurons may provide a realistic biophysical mechanism
	for producing ETs that persist on a timescale consistent with behavioral
	observations.},

  abstract = {How does the brain learn to balance between reactive and planned behaviors?
	The basal ganglia (BG) and frontal cortex together allow animals
	to learn planned behaviors that acquire rewards when prepotent reactive
	behaviors are insufficient. This paper proposes a new model, called
	TELOS, to explain how laminar circuitry of the frontal cortex, exemplified
	by the frontal eye fields, interacts with the BG, thalamus, superior
	colliculus, and inferotemporal and parietal cortices to learn and
	perform reactive and planned eye movements. The model is formulated
	as fourteen computational hypotheses. These specify how strategy
	priming and action planning (in cortical layers III, Va and VI) are
	dissociated from movement execution (in layer Vb), how the BG help
	to choose among and gate competing plans, and how a visual stimulus
	may serve either as a movement target or as a discriminative cue
	to move elsewhere. The direct, indirect and hyperdirect pathways
	through the BG are shown to enable complex gating functions, including
	deferred execution of selected plans, and switching among alternative
	sensory-motor mappings. Notably, the model can learn and gate the
	use of a What-to-Where transformation that enables spatially invariant
	object representations to selectively excite spatially coded movement
	plans. Model simulations show how dopaminergic reward and non-reward
	signals guide monkeys to learn and perform saccadic eye movements
	in the fixation, single saccade, overlap, gap, and delay (memory-guided)
	saccade tasks. Model cell activation dynamics quantitatively simulate
	seventeen established types of dynamics exhibited by corresponding
	real cells during performance of these tasks.},

  abstract = {; We examined inhibitory control in an oculomotor countermanding task,
	where the primary task required a saccadic eye movement be made to
	a target and a less-frequent secondary task required that the movement
	be halted. Previous studies have used a visual stimulus presented
	centrally on the fovea as the signal to stop or countermand a saccade.
	In these previous studies, there are at least two possible sources
	of saccadic inhibition: (1) sensory stimulation at the fovea can
	elicit a bottom-up mechanism, where a visual transient signal can
	delay or inhibit the developing saccade command; and (2) information
	based on the task instruction can be used to initiate a top-down
	mechanism to halt the movement. In the present study, we used both
	visual and auditory stop signals to test the hypothesis that the
	bottom-up mechanism is activated only after presentation of a foveal
	visual stop signal. Subjects were instructed first to look at a central
	spot and then to look to an eccentric visual target that appeared
	randomly to the left or right of center. On about one-third of the
	trials, a stop signal was presented. Three types of stop signals
	were used with equal probability: a broad-band noise burst (auditory),
	a central fixation spot (visual), and a combination of the auditory
	and visual stimuli (combined). Saccadic reaction time and stop-signal
	accuracy were used to calculate stop signal reaction time (SSRT),
	an estimate of the time required to inhibit the eye movement. Mean
	SSRT was longer for the auditory stop signals (201\&nbsp;ms) than
	for the signals with a foveal visual component (visual 113\&nbsp;ms;
	combined 91\&nbsp;ms). We conclude that a foveal visual stop signal
	in an oculomotor countermanding task changes the measure of inhibitory
	control to reflect not only inhibitory processes but also the sensory
	information afforded by stimulation at the fovea.},

	compared with when that effector was at rest. Further, this neural
	index of proactive and selective suppression predicted the subsequent
	selectivity with which the behavioral response was stopped. These
	results go further than earlier reports of reduced motor excitability
	when responses are stopped. They show that the control can be applied

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Our previous work described the neural processes of motor
	response inhibition during a stop signal task (SST). Employing the
	race model, we computed the stop signal reaction time (SSRT) to index
	individuals' ability in inhibitory control. The pre-supplementary
	motor area (preSMA), which shows greater activity in individuals
	with short as compared to those with long SSRT, plays a role in mediating
	response inhibition. In contrast, the right inferior prefrontal cortex
	(rIFC) showed greater activity during stop success as compared to
	stop error. Here we further pursued this functional differentiation
	of preSMA and rIFC on the basis of an intra-subject approach. RESULTS:
	Of 65 subjects who participated in four sessions of the SST, we identified
	30 individuals who showed a difference in SSRT but were identical
	in other aspects of stop signal performance between the first ("early")
	and last two ("late") sessions. By comparing regional brain activation
	between the two sessions, we confirmed greater preSMA but not rIFC
	activity during short as compared to long SSRT session within individuals.
	Furthermore, putamen, anterior cerebellum and middle/posterior cingulate
	cortex also showed greater activity in association with short SSRT.
	CONCLUSION: These results are consistent with a role of medial prefrontal
	cortex in controlled action and inferior frontal cortex in orienting
	attention. We discussed these findings with respect to the process
	of attentional monitoring and inhibitory motor control during stop
	signal inhibition.},

	in other words, inhibition requires the ability to monitor context

	Using behavioral, neuroimaging, electrophysiological and computational
	approaches, we tested whether motoric stopping per se is the cognitively-controlled

	demands. These results challenge dominant accounts of inhibitory
	control, which posit that motoric stopping is the cognitively-controlled

	frontal substrates of response inhibition by replacing the centrality
	of controlled mechanisms for motoric stopping with context-monitoring.},

	This can occur either proactively to anticipate task requirements,
	or reactively in response to sudden changes. Here we report neuronal
	activity in the supplementary motor area (SMA) that is correlated
	with both forms of behavioral control. Single-unit and multiunit
	activity and intracranial local field potentials (LFPs) were recorded
	in macaque monkeys during a stop-signal task, which elicits both
	proactive and reactive behavioral control. The LFP power in high-
	(60-150 Hz) and low- (25-40 Hz) frequency bands was significantly
	correlated with arm movement reaction time, starting before target
	onset. Multiunit and single-unit activity also showed a significant
	regression with reaction time. In addition, LFPs and multiunit and
	single-unit activity changed their activity level depending on the
	trial history, mirroring adjustments on the behavioral level. Together,
	these findings indicate that neuronal activity in the SMA exerts
	proactive control of arm movements by adjusting the level of motor
	readiness. On trials when the monkeys successfully canceled arm movements
	in response to an unforeseen stop signal, the LFP power, particularly
	in a low (10-50 Hz) frequency range, increased early enough to be
	causally related to the inhibition of the arm movement on those trials.
	This indicated that neuronal activity in the SMA is also involved
	in response inhibition in reaction to sudden task changes. Our findings
	indicate, therefore, that SMA plays a role in the proactive control

	by a shared scheme using all available sensory signals. Using a psychometric
	approach, seven human subjects were tested on two orientation estimates

	and perception of visual vertical [subjective visual vertical (SVV)].
	In all subjects, the SBT was more accurate than the SVV, which showed
	substantial systematic errors for tilt angles beyond 60°. Variability
	increased with tilt angle in both tasks, but was consistently lower
	in the SVV. The sensory integration model fitted both datasets very
	nicely. A further experiment, in which supine subjects judged their
	head orientation relative to the body, independently confirmed the
	predicted head-on-body noise by the model. Model predictions based
	on the derived noise properties from the various modalities were
	also consistent with previously published deficits in vestibular

	mechanisms involved in higher level cognitive functions. The interaction
	of these systems remains poorly understood, and models of human behavior
	often ignore working memory (WM) and therefore incorrectly assign
	behavioral variance to the RL system. Here we designed a task that
	highlights the profound entanglement of these two processes, even
	in simple learning problems. By systematically varying the size of
	the learning problem and delay between stimulus repetitions, we separately
	extracted WM-specific effects of load and delay on learning. We propose
	a new computational model that accounts for the dynamic integration

	capacity-limited WM into the model allowed us to capture behavioral
	variance that could not be captured in a pure RL framework even if
	we (implausibly) allowed separate RL systems for each set size. The
	WM component also allowed for a more reasonable estimation of a single
	RL process. Finally, we report effects of two genetic polymorphisms
	having relative specificity for prefrontal and basal ganglia functions.
	Whereas the COMT gene coding for catechol-O-methyl transferase selectively
	influenced model estimates of WM capacity, the GPR6 gene coding for
	G-protein-coupled receptor 6 influenced the RL learning rate. Thus,

	of the internal value of stimuli per se. We used a single-bottle
	forced-choice task to investigate the role of dopamine in learning
	the value of tastants. We show that dopamine transporter knock-out
	mice (DAT-KO), which have constitutively elevated dopamine levels,
	develop a more positive bias towards a hedonically positive tastant
	(sucrose 400 mM) than their wild-type littermates. Furthermore, when
	compared to wild-type littermates, DAT-KO mice develop a less negative
	bias towards a hedonically negative tastant (quinine HCl 10 mM).
	Importantly, these effects develop with training, because at the
	onset of training DAT-KO and wild-type mice display similar biases

  abstract = {While there is general agreement that in Parkinson's disease (PD),
	striatal dopamine (DA) depletion causes motor deficits, the origin
	of the associated cognitive impairments remains a matter of debate.
	The present study aimed to decipher the influence of a partial 6-hydroxydopamine
	(6-OHDA) lesion of striatal DA nerve terminals in rats performing
	a reaction time task previously used to assess cognitive deficits
	in PD patients. The effects of two behavioral manipulations--foreperiod
	duration and stimulus-response congruence--known to affect motor
	processes and executive control, respectively, were studied over
	8 weeks postsurgery in control and lesion animals. Two weeks after
	surgery, the lesion abolished the effect of foreperiod, confirming
	the direct involvement of striatal DA in motor processes, but failed
	to alter the effect of congruence. During the following weeks, the
	effect of foreperiod was reinstated, indicating a recovery of lesion-induced
	motor symptoms. This recovery was accompanied by a progressive increase
	of the congruence effect, signaling an executive control deficit
	in lesion animals. This result provides the first evidence that 6-OHDA
	lesioned rats exhibit the same cognitive impairment as PD patients
	in this task. The deficit, however, built up progressively after
	the lesion and may result from adaptations mitigating lesion-induced
	motor deficits.},

	of affective and executive functions, but its precise contribution
	to motivation remains unclear. One influential hypothesis has implicated
	serotonin in aversive processing; another has proposed a more general
	role for serotonin in behavioral inhibition. Because behavioral inhibition
	is a prepotent reaction to aversive outcomes, it has been a challenge
	to reconcile these two accounts. Here, we show that serotonin is
	critical for punishment-induced inhibition but not overall motor
	response inhibition or reporting aversive outcomes. We used acute
	tryptophan depletion to temporarily lower brain serotonin in healthy
	human volunteers as they completed a novel task designed to obtain
	separate measures of motor response inhibition, punishment-induced
	inhibition, and sensitivity to aversive outcomes. After a placebo
	treatment, participants were slower to respond under punishment conditions
	compared with reward conditions. Tryptophan depletion abolished this
	punishment-induced inhibition without affecting overall motor response
	inhibition or the ability to adjust response bias in line with punishment
	contingencies. The magnitude of reduction in punishment-induced inhibition
	depended on the degree to which tryptophan depletion reduced plasma
	tryptophan levels. These findings extend and clarify previous research
	on the role of serotonin in aversive processing and behavioral inhibition
	and fit with current theorizing on the involvement of serotonin in
	predicting aversive outcomes.},

	the nature of the representations of events that enter into learning.
	This issue has been explored extensively with regard to the question
	of what features of the unconditioned stimulus enter into learning,
	but considerably less work has been directed to the question of characterizing
	the nature of the conditioned stimulus. This article introduces a
	multilayered connectionist network approach to understanding how
	"perceptual" or "conceptual" representations of the conditioned stimulus
	might emerge from conditioning and participate in various learning
	phenomena. The model is applied to acquired equivalence/distinctiveness

	learning tasks (patterning, biconditional, ambiguous occasion setting,
	feature discriminations). In addition, studies that have examined
	what aspects of the unconditioned stimulus enter into learning are
	also reviewed. Ultimately, it is concluded that adopting a multilayered
	connectionist network perspective of Pavlovian learning provides
	us with a richer way in which to view basic learning processes, but
	a number of key theoretical problems remain to be solved, particularly
	as they relate to the integration of what we know about the nature

	attention in recent imaging literature. Many studies have used the
	go/no-go or stop signal task to examine the neural processes underlying
	motor response inhibition. In particular, showing greater activity
	during no-go (stop) compared with go trials and during stop success
	compared with stop error trials, the right inferior prefrontal cortex
	(IFC) has been suggested by numerous studies as the cortical area
	mediating response inhibition. Many of these same studies as well
	as others have also implicated the presupplementary motor area (preSMA)
	in this process, in accord with a function of the medial prefrontal
	cortex in goal-directed action. Here we used connectivity analyses
	to delineate the roles of IFC and preSMA during stop signal inhibition.
	Specifically, we hypothesized that, as an integral part of the ventral
	attention system, the IFC responds to a stop signal and expedites
	the stop process in the preSMA, the primary site of motor response
	inhibition. This hypothesis predicted that preSMA and primary motor
	cortex would show functional interconnectivity via the basal ganglia
	circuitry to mediate response execution or inhibition, whereas the
	IFC would influence the basal ganglia circuitry via connectivity
	with preSMA. The results of Granger causality analyses in 57 participants
	confirmed this hypothesis. Furthermore, psychophysiological interaction
	showed that, compared with stop errors, stop successes evoked greater
	effective connectivity between the IFC and preSMA, providing additional
	support for this hypothesis. These new findings provided evidence
	critically differentiating the roles of IFC and preSMA during stop
	signal inhibition and have important implications for our understanding

	as a neurobiological disorder of the prefrontal cortex and its connections.
	Circuits with the prefrontal cortex relevant to ADHD include dorsal
	frontostriatal, orbitofronto-striatal, and fronto-cerebellar circuits.
	Dorsal frontostriatal circuitry has been linked to cognitive control,
	whereas orbitofronto-striatal loops have been related to reward processing.
	Fronto-cerebellar circuits have been implicated in timing. Neurobiological
	dysfunction in any of these circuits could lead to symptoms of ADHD,

	cortex itself; or 2) problems in the circuits relaying information
	to the prefrontal cortex, leading to reduced signaling for control.
	This article suggests a model for differentiating between interlinked
	reciprocal circuits with the prefrontal cortex in ADHD. If such a
	differentiation can be achieved, it might permit a neurobiological
	subtyping of ADHD, perhaps by defining "dorsal fronto-striatal,"
	"orbitofronto-striatal," or "fronto-cerebellar" subtypes of ADHD.

  abstract = {In serial stage models, perception and action are usually thought
	to be linked to each other by an S-R translation mechanism. However,
	phenomena of S-R compatibility suggest a more direct relationship
	between perceptual and action domains. We discuss behavioral and
	psychophysiological evidence that irrelevant stimulus information
	automatically activates response codes, but then decays over time.
	In a series of reaction time studies and electrophysiological experiments,
	we investigated both temporal and functional properties of the assumed
	automatic response activation process. We found that the amount of
	interference due to irrelevant spatial information depends upon how
	long its availability precedes that of the information relevant for
	response selection. This indicates that response activation decays
	rather quickly. If response-relevant and irrelevant spatial information
	are simultaneously available, electrophysiological measurements show
	that automatic activation of the spatially corresponding response
	rises soon after stimulus onset, but then dissipates and gets replaced
	by the activation of the response indicated by the relevant stimulus
	attribute. We conclude that these findings do not support a pure
	translation account, but rather suggest the presence of two parallel
	and (at least partially) independent routes from perception to action:
	A direct route, allowing for automatic activation of response codes
	if stimulus and response features overlap, and an indirect route
	linking S and R codes in an arbitrary manner. Via the direct route
	responses may be primed independent of task-specific contingencies,
	while the correct response is selected via the indirect route. This
	use suggests that (a) the transmission of stimulus information to
	response stages does not (fully) depend on task relevance and that

	action by requiring subjects to withhold a planned movement in response
	to an infrequent stop signal which they do with variable success
	depending on the delay of the stop signal. We investigated whether
	performance of humans and macaque monkeys in a saccade countermanding
	task was influenced by stimulus and performance history. In spite
	of idiosyncrasies across subjects several trends were evident in
	both humans and monkeys. Response time decreased after successive
	trials with no stop signal. Response time increased after successive
	trials with a stop signal. However, post-error slowing was not observed.
	Increased response time was observed mainly or only after cancelled
	(signal inhibit) trials and not after noncancelled (signal respond)
	trials. These global trends were based on rapid adjustments of response
	time in response to momentary fluctuations in the fraction of stop
	signal trials. The effects of trial sequence on the probability of
	responding were weaker and more idiosyncratic across subjects when
	stop signal fraction was fixed. However, both response time and probability
	of responding were influenced strongly by variations in the fraction
	of stop signal trials. These results indicate that the race model
	of countermanding performance requires extension to account for these
	sequential dependencies and provide a basis for physiological studies
	of executive control of countermanding saccade performance.},

	When people are engaged in activities such as shopping, driving,
	or playing chess, they have to continually balance the demands for
	fast decisions against the demands for accurate decisions. In the
	cognitive sciences, this balance is thought to be modulated by a
	response threshold, the neural substrate of which is currently subject
	to speculation. In a speed decision-making experiment, we presented
	participants with cues that indicated different requirements for
	response speed. Application of a mathematical model for the behavioral
	data confirmed that cueing for speed lowered the response threshold.
	Functional neuroimaging showed that cueing for speed activates the
	striatum and the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA), brain structures
	that are part of a closed-loop motor circuit involved in the preparation
	of voluntary action plans. Moreover, activation in the striatum is
	known to release the motor system from global inhibition, thereby
	facilitating faster but possibly premature actions. Finally, the
	data show that individual variation in the activation of striatum
	and pre-SMA is selectively associated with individual variation in
	the amplitude of the adjustments in the response threshold estimated
	by the mathematical model. These results demonstrate that when people
	have to make decisions under time pressure their striatum and pre-SMA
	show increased levels of activation.},

	more time to respond than young adults. One of the reasons for this
	age-related slowing is that older adults are reluctant to commit
	errors, a cautious attitude that prompts them to accumulate more
	information before making a decision (Rabbitt, 1979). This suggests
	that age-related slowing may be partly due to unwillingness on behalf
	of elderly participants to adopt a fast-but-careless setting when
	asked. We investigate the neuroanatomical and neurocognitive basis
	of age-related slowing in a perceptual decision-making task where
	cues instructed young and old participants to respond either quickly
	or accurately. Mathematical modeling of the behavioral data confirmed
	that cueing for speed encouraged participants to set low response
	thresholds, but this was more evident in younger than older participants.
	Diffusion weighted structural images suggest that the more cautious
	threshold settings of older participants may be due to a reduction
	of white matter integrity in corticostriatal tracts that connect
	the pre-SMA to the striatum. These results are consistent with the
	striatal account of the speed-accuracy tradeoff according to which
	an increased emphasis on response speed increases the cortical input
	to the striatum, resulting in global disinhibition of the cortex.
	Our findings suggest that the unwillingness of older adults to adopt
	fast speed-accuracy tradeoff settings may not just reflect a strategic
	choice that is entirely under voluntary control, but that it may
	also reflect structural limitations: age-related decrements in brain
	connectivity.},

	We show that two genes controlling striatal dopamine function, DARPP-32

	learning to adjust response times incrementally as a function of
	positive and negative decision outcomes. In contrast, a gene primarily
	controlling prefrontal dopamine function (COMT) is associated with
	a particular type of 'directed exploration', in which exploratory
	decisions are made in proportion to Bayesian uncertainty about whether
	other choices might produce outcomes that are better than the status

	not be explained by direct stimulus/response repetitions. These findings

	Performance on tasks of this nature are impaired in schizophrenia

	attenuated by administration of dopamine (DA) antagonists. Rats were
	trained on either a complex instrumental discrimination task, that
	required the use of task-setting cues, or a simple discrimination
	task that did not. Following training, microdialysis probes were
	implanted unilaterally in either the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)
	or nucleus accumbens (NAc) and samples were collected in freely moving
	animals during a behavioural test session. In Experiment 1, we found
	no difference in levels of DA in the mPFC of rats while they were
	performing the two discrimination tasks. Rats that performed the
	complex task did, however, show significantly higher mPFC DA levels

	the end of the behavioural test session. In Experiment 2, rats performing

	associated with cognitive control (response inhibition, conflict
	monitoring, and switching), which included the dorsolateral prefrontal
	cortex and anterior cingulate cortex and a second associated with
	value-based decision-making, which included the orbitofrontal, ventromedial,
	and frontopolar cortex. Furthermore, cognitive control tasks shared
	a common performance factor related to set shifting that was linked
	to the rostral anterior cingulate cortex. By contrast, regions in
	the ventral PFC were required for decision-making. These findings

	from putative synaptically-connected pairs of thalamic neurons and
	their pallidal inputs in singing zebra finches. We find, first, that
	each pallidal spike produces an extremely brief (\~{}5 ms) pulse
	of inhibition that completely suppresses thalamic spiking. As a result,
	thalamic spikes are entrained to pallidal spikes with submillisecond
	precision. Second, we find that the number of thalamic spikes that
	discharge within a single pallidal interspike interval (ISI) depends
	linearly on the duration of that interval, but does not depend on
	pallidal activity prior to the interval. In a detailed biophysical
	model, our results were not easily explained by the postinhibitory
	'rebound' mechanism previously observed in anesthetized birds and
	in brain slices, nor could most of our data be characterized as 'gating'
	of excitatory transmission by inhibitory pallidal input. Instead,
	we propose a novel 'entrainment' model of pallido-thalamic transmission
	that highlights the importance of an excitatory conductance that
	drives spiking interacting with brief pulses of pallidal inhibition.
	Building on our recent finding that cortical inputs can drive syllable-locked
	rate modulations in thalamic neurons during singing, we report here
	that excitatory inputs affect thalamic spiking in two ways: by speeding
	the onset of spiking following a pallidal spike, and by increasing
	thalamic firing rates within individual pallidal ISIs. We present
	a unifying biophysical model that can reproduce all known modes of
	pallidothalamic transmission-rebound, gating and entrainment-depending
	on the amount of excitation the thalamic neuron receives.},

  abstract = {Much research has focused on how people stop initiated response tendencies
	when instructed by a signal. Stopping of this kind appears to have
	global effects on the motor system. For example, by delivering Transcranial
	Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) over the leg area of primary motor cortex
	it is possible to detect suppression in the leg when the hand is
	being stopped (Badry R et al. 2009, Suppression of human cortico-motoneuronal
	excitability during the Stop-signal task. Clin Neurophysiol 120:1717-1723).
	Here we asked if such 'global suppression' can be observed proactively
	- i.e when people anticipate they might have to stop. We used a conditional
	stop signal task which allows measurement of both an 'anticipation
	phase' (i.e. where proactive control is applied) and a 'stopping'
	phase. TMS was delivered during the anticipation phase (experiment
	1), and also during the stopping phase (experiments 1 and 2) in order
	to measure leg excitability. During the anticipation phase we did
	not observe leg suppression, but we did during the stopping phase,
	consistent with Badry et al. (2009). Moreover, when splitting the
	subjects into those who slowed down behaviorally (i.e. exercised
	proactive control) and those who did not, we found that subjects
	who slowed did not show leg suppression when they stopped, while
	those who did not slow did show leg suppression when they stopped.
	These results suggest that if subjects prepare to stop then they
	do so without global effects on the motor system. Thus, preparation
	allows them to stop more selectively.},

	response to repetitive presentations of a startling stimulus. Conversely,
	the loss of the dopamine D2 or D3 receptor gene produced a sensitization
	deficit and a significant increase in habituation. The behavioral

  abstract = {Ecology Letters (2011) ABSTRACT: Statistical models are the traditional
	choice to test scientific theories when observations, processes or
	boundary conditions are subject to stochasticity. Many important
	systems in ecology and biology, however, are difficult to capture
	with statistical models. Stochastic simulation models offer an alternative,
	but they were hitherto associated with a major disadvantage: their
	likelihood functions can usually not be calculated explicitly, and
	thus it is difficult to couple them to well-established statistical
	theory such as maximum likelihood and Bayesian statistics. A number
	of new methods, among them Approximate Bayesian Computing and Pattern-Oriented
	Modelling, bypass this limitation. These methods share three main
	principles: aggregation of simulated and observed data via summary
	statistics, likelihood approximation based on the summary statistics,
	and efficient sampling. We discuss principles as well as advantages
	and caveats of these methods, and demonstrate their potential for
	integrating stochastic simulation models into a unified framework
	for statistical modelling.},

  abstract = {This study investigated the preparatory control of motor inhibition

	triggered a prepotent response and a less frequent "stop" signal
	prompted the inhibition of this response. Preparatory control of
	motor inhibition and execution in the stop signal trials were examined
	by contrasting brain activation between stop success and stop error
	trials during the fore-period, in which participants prepared to
	respond to go or to stop. Results from 91 healthy adults showed greater
	activation in the right prefrontal cortex and inferior parietal lobule

	activated bilateral putamen, primary motor cortices, posterior cingulate

	of the frontal eye fields (FEF) in squirrel, owl, and macaque monkeys.
	In some of the same owl and macaque monkeys, intracortical microstimulation
	was also used to evoke eye movements from dorsomedial frontal cortex
	(the supplementary motor area). In addition, in all of the owl and
	squirrel monkeys, intracortical microstimulation was also used to
	evoke body movements from the premotor and motor cortex situated
	between the central dimple and the FEF. These microstimulation data
	were directly compared to the distribution of anterogradely and retrogradely
	transported label resulting from injections of tracer into the FEF
	in each monkey. Since the injection sites were limited to the physiologically
	defined FEF, the demonstrated connections were solely those of the
	FEF. To aid in the interpretation of areal patterns of connections,
	the relatively smooth cortex of owl and squirrel monkeys was unfolded,
	flattened, and cut parallel to the flattened surface. Cortex of macaque
	monkeys, which has numerous deep sulci, was cut coronally. Reciprocal
	connections with the ipsilateral frontal lobe were similar in all
	three species: dorsomedial cortex (supplementary motor area), cortex
	just rostral (periprincipal prefrontal cortex) to the FEF, and cortex
	just caudal (premotor cortex) to the FEF. In squirrel and owl monkeys,
	extensive reciprocal connections were made with cortex throughout
	the caudal half of the lateral fissure and, to a much lesser extent,
	cortex around the superior temporal sulcus. In macaque monkeys, only
	sparse connections were present with cortex of the lateral fissure,
	but extensive and dense connections were made with cortex throughout
	the caudal one-third to one-half of the superior temporal sulcus.
	In addition, very dense reciprocal connections were made with the
	cortex of the lateral, or inferior, bank of the intraparietal sulcus.
	Contralateral reciprocal connections in all three species were virtually
	limited to regions that correspond in location to the FEF and the

	(IFG) and adjacent insular cortex, and in the anterior cingulate

	development through adolescence. Previous human developmental imaging
	studies have found immaturities in localized brain activity in children

	analysis to characterize developmental changes in effective connectivity
	underlying inhibitory control (antisaccade task) compared with reflexive

	few top-down connectivities were evident with increased parietal
	interconnectivity. By adolescence, connections from prefrontal cortex
	increased and parietal interconnectivity decreased. From adolescence
	to adulthood, there was evidence of increased number and strength
	of frontal connections to cortical regions as well as subcortical
	regions. Together, results suggest that developmental improvements
	in inhibitory control may be supported by age-related enhancements

  abstract = {Voluntary motor commands produce two kinds of consequences. Initially,
	a sensory consequence is observed in terms of activity in our primary
	sensory organs (e.g., vision, proprioception). Subsequently, the
	brain evaluates the sensory feedback and produces a subjective measure
	of utility or usefulness of the motor commands (e.g., reward). As
	a result, comparisons between predicted and observed consequences
	of motor commands produce two forms of prediction error. How do these
	errors contribute to changes in motor commands? Here, we considered
	a reach adaptation protocol and found that when high quality sensory
	feedback was available, adaptation of motor commands was driven almost
	exclusively by sensory prediction errors. This form of learning had
	a distinct signature: as motor commands adapted, the subjects altered
	their predictions regarding sensory consequences of motor commands,
	and generalized this learning broadly to neighboring motor commands.
	In contrast, as the quality of the sensory feedback degraded, adaptation
	of motor commands became more dependent on reward prediction errors.
	Reward prediction errors produced comparable changes in the motor
	commands, but produced no change in the predicted sensory consequences
	of motor commands, and generalized only locally. Because we found
	that there was a within subject correlation between generalization
	patterns and sensory remapping, it is plausible that during adaptation
	an individual's relative reliance on sensory vs. reward prediction
	errors could be inferred. We suggest that while motor commands change
	because of sensory and reward prediction errors, only sensory prediction
	errors produce a change in the neural system that predicts sensory
	consequences of motor commands.},

	preSMA into the rCaudate were correlated negatively. If participants

  abstract = {The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) has been implicated in
	the ability to perform complex behaviors requiring the implementation
	of cognitive control. A central supposition of models of prefrontal
	function is that the DLPFC engages control by selectively modulating
	the activity of target structures to which it is connected, but no
	studies in the primate have directly investigated DLPFC output signals.
	Here, we recorded the activity of DLPFC neurons identified as sending
	a direct projection to the superior colliculus, a midbrain oculomotor
	structure, while monkeys performed alternating blocks of trials in
	which they had to look toward a flashed peripheral stimulus (prosaccades)
	and trials in which they had to look away from the stimulus in the
	opposite direction (antisaccades). We report the first direct evidence
	that the primate DLPFC sends task-selective signals to a target structure.
	This supports the notion that the DLPFC orchestrates the activity
	of other brain areas in accordance with task requirements.},

  abstract = {Objective: Slow and variable reaction times (RTs) on fast tasks are
	such a prominent feature of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder
	(ADHD) that any theory must account for them. However, this has proven
	difficult because the cognitive mechanisms responsible for this effect
	remain unexplained. Although speed and variability are typically
	correlated, it is unclear whether single or multiple mechanisms are
	responsible for group differences in each. RTs are a result of several
	semi-independent processes, including stimulus encoding, rate of
	information processing, speed–accuracy trade-offs, and motor response,
	which have not been previously well characterized. Method: A diffusion
	model was applied to RTs from a forced-choice RT paradigm in two
	large, independent case-control samples (N Cohort 1 = 214 and N Cohort
	2 = 172). The decomposition measured three validated parameters that
	account for the full RT distribution and assessed reproducibility
	of ADHD effects. Results: In both samples, group differences in traditional
	RT variables were explained by slow information processing speed,
	and unrelated to speed–accuracy trade-offs or nondecisional processes
	(e.g., encoding, motor response). Conclusions: RT speed and variability
	in ADHD may be explained by a single information processing parameter,
	potentially simplifying explanations that assume different mechanisms
	are required to account for group differences in the mean and variability
	of RTs. },

  abstract = {Previous research indicates that behavioral performance in simple
	probability learning tasks can be organized into response strategy
	classifications that are thought to predict important personal characteristics
	and individual differences. Typically, relatively small proportion
	of subjects can be identified as optimizers for effectively exploiting
	the environment and choosing the more rewarding stimulus nearly all
	of the time. In contrast, the vast majority of subjects behaves sub-optimally
	and adopts the matching or super-matching strategy, apportioning
	their responses in a way that matches or slightly exceeds the probabilities
	of reinforcement. In the present study, we administered a two-choice
	probability learning paradigm to 51 individuals with schizophrenia
	(SZ) and 29 healthy controls (NC) to examine whether there are differences
	in the proportion of subjects falling into these response strategy
	classifications, and to determine whether task performance is differentially
	associated with symptom severity and neuropsychological functioning.
	Although the sample of SZ patients did not differ from NC in overall
	rate of learning or end performance, significant clinical differences
	emerged when patients were divided into optimizing, super-matching
	and matching subgroups based upon task performance. Patients classified
	as optimizers, who adopted the most advantageous learning strategy,
	exhibited higher levels of positive and negative symptoms than their
	matching and super-matching counterparts. Importantly, when both
	positive and negative symptoms were considered together, only negative
	symptom severity was a significant predictor of whether a subject
	would behave optimally, with each one standard deviation increase
	in negative symptoms increasing the odds of a patient being an optimizer
	by as much as 80\%. These data provide a rare example of a greater
	clinical impairment being associated with better behavioral performance.},

  abstract = {Neural circuits of the basal ganglia are critical for motor planning
	and action selection. Two parallel basal ganglia pathways have been
	described, and have been proposed to exert opposing influences on
	motor function. According to this classical model, activation of
	the 'direct' pathway facilitates movement and activation of the 'indirect'
	pathway inhibits movement. However, more recent anatomical and functional
	evidence has called into question the validity of this hypothesis.
	Because this model has never been empirically tested, the specific
	function of these circuits in behaving animals remains unknown. Here
	we report direct activation of basal ganglia circuitry in vivo, using
	optogenetic control of direct- and indirect-pathway medium spiny
	projection neurons (MSNs), achieved through Cre-dependent viral expression
	of channelrhodopsin-2 in the striatum of bacterial artificial chromosome
	transgenic mice expressing Cre recombinase under control of regulatory
	elements for the dopamine D1 or D2 receptor. Bilateral excitation
	of indirect-pathway MSNs elicited a parkinsonian state, distinguished
	by increased freezing, bradykinesia and decreased locomotor initiations.
	In contrast, activation of direct-pathway MSNs reduced freezing and
	increased locomotion. In a mouse model of Parkinson's disease, direct-pathway
	activation completely rescued deficits in freezing, bradykinesia
	and locomotor initiation. Taken together, our findings establish
	a critical role for basal ganglia circuitry in the bidirectional
	regulation of motor behaviour and indicate that modulation of direct-pathway
	circuitry may represent an effective therapeutic strategy for ameliorating
	parkinsonian motor deficits.},

  abstract = {Bayesian models offer great flexibility for clustering applications---Bayesian
	nonparametrics can be used for modeling infinite mixtures, and hierarchical
	Bayesian models can be utilized for sharing clusters across multiple
	data sets. For the most part, such flexibility is lacking in classical
	clustering methods such as k-means. In this paper, we revisit the
	k-means clustering algorithm from a Bayesian nonparametric viewpoint.
	Inspired by the asymptotic connection between k-means and mixtures
	of Gaussians, we show that a Gibbs sampling algorithm for the Dirichlet
	process mixture approaches a hard clustering algorithm in the limit,
	and further that the resulting algorithm monotonically minimizes
	an elegant underlying k-means-like clustering objective that includes
	a penalty for the number of clusters. We generalize this analysis
	to the case of clustering multiple data sets through a similar asymptotic
	argument with the hierarchical Dirichlet process. We also discuss
	further extensions that highlight the benefits of our analysis: i)
	a spectral relaxation involving thresholded eigenvectors, and ii)
	a normalized cut graph clustering algorithm that does not fix the
	number of clusters in the graph.},

	for this flexible behavioral control have been examined using the
	antisaccade paradigm. In this task, subjects suppress saccades to
	the sudden appearance of visual stimuli (prosaccade) and make a saccade
	in the opposite direction. Because recent imaging studies showed
	enhanced activity in the thalamus and basal ganglia during antisaccades,
	we hypothesized that the corticobasal ganglia loop may be involved.
	To test this, we recorded from neurons in the paralaminar part of
	the ventroanterior (VA), ventrolateral (VL) and mediodorsal (MD)
	nuclei of the thalamus when 3 monkeys performed pro/antisaccade tasks.
	For many VL and some VA neurons, the firing rate was greater during
	anti- than prosaccades. In contrast, neurons in the MD thalamus showed
	much variety of responses. For the population as a whole, neuronal
	activity in the VA/VL thalamus was strongly enhanced during antisaccades
	compared with prosaccades, while activity in the MD nucleus was not.
	Inactivation of the VA/VL thalamus resulted in an increase in the
	number of error trials in the antisaccade tasks, indicating that
	signals in the motor thalamus play roles in the generation of antisaccades.
	Enhancement of firing modulation during antisaccades found in the
	thalamus and those reported previously in the supplementary eye field
	and the basal ganglia suggest a strong functional linkage between
	these structures. The neuronal processes through the thalamocortical
	pathways might be essential for the volitional control of saccades.},

	(S-R) associations in first-order fear conditioning. After behaviorally
	complete devaluation of the unconditioned stimulus, the target stimulus

  abstract = {Knowledge concerning the classification of mental disorders progressed
	substantially with the use of DSM III-IV and IDCD 10 because it was
	based on observed data, with precise definitions. These classifications
	a priori avoided to generate definitions related to etiology or treatment
	response. They are based on a categorical approach where diagnostic
	entities share common phenomenological features. Modifications proposed
	or discussed are related to the weak validity of the classification
	strategy described above. (a) Disorders are supposed to be independent
	but the current coexistence of two or more disorders is the rule;
	(b) They also are supposed to have stability, however anxiety disorders
	most of the time precede major depression. For GAD age at onset,
	family history, biology and symptomatology are close to those of
	depression. As a consequence broader entities such as depression-GAD
	spectrum, panic-phobias spectrum and OCD spectrum including eating
	disorders and pathological gambling are taken into consideration;
	(c) Diagnostic categories use thresholds to delimitate a border with
	normals. This creates "subthreshold" conditions. The relevance of
	such conditions is well documented. Measuring the presence and severity
	of different dimensions, independent from a threshold, will improve
	the relevance of the description of patients pathology. In addition,
	this dimensional approach will improve the problems posed by the
	mutually exclusive diagnoses (depression and GAD, schizophrenia and
	depression); (d) Some disorders are based on the coexistence of different
	dimensions. Patients may present only one set of symptoms and have
	different characteristics, evolution and response to treatment. An
	example would be negative symptoms in Schizophrenia; (e) Because
	no etiological model is available and most measures are subjective,
	objective measures (cognitive, biological) and genetics progresses
	created important hopes. None of these measures is pathognomonic
	and most appear to be related to risk factors especially at certain
	periods when associated with environmental events. One of the major
	aims for a classification of patients is to identify groups to whom
	a best possible therapeutic strategy can be proposed. Drugs may improve
	fear extinction while the genetic and/or acquired avoidance may be
	called phobia. The basic mechanism and or the corresponding phenotype
	should appear in the classification. Progresses in early identification
	of disturbances by taking into account all the information available
	(prodromal symptoms, cognitive, biological, imaging, genetic, family
	information) are crucial for the future therapeutic strategy: prevention.},

	due to its integral role in normal cognition and clinical disorders.
	The stop-signal task and associated measure--stop-signal reaction
	time (SSRT)--provides a well-established paradigm for measuring response
	inhibition. However, motivational influences on stop-signal performance
	and SSRT have not been examined. We conceptualize the stop-signal
	paradigm as a decision-making task involving the trade-off between
	fast responding and accurate inhibition. In 4 experiments, we demonstrate
	that performance trade-offs are influenced by inherent motivational
	biases and explicit strategic control. As a result, SSRT was lower
	when participants favored correct stopping over fast responding than
	when the same participants favored fast responding over correct stopping.
	We present a novel variant of the stop-signal task that uses monetary
	incentives to manipulate motivated speed-accuracy trade-offs. By
	sampling performance at multiple-trade-off settings, we obtain a
	measure of inhibitory ability that is independent of trade-off bias,
	and thus, more easily interpretable when comparing across participants.
	We present a working theoretical model to explain the effects of
	motivational context on response inhibition.},

	an anxiety disorder characterized by compulsions aimed at reducing
	anxiety associated with intrusive cognitions. However, compulsive
	behaviors such as repeated checking were found to increase rather
	than decrease uncertainty related to obsessive thoughts (e.g., whether
	the gas stove was turned off). Some recent studies illustrate that
	OCD patients and their family members have inhibitory deficits, often
	demonstrated by the stop-signal task. The current study aims to investigate
	relations between inhibitory control and effects of repeated checking.
	METHODS: Fifty-five healthy participants carried out a stop-signal
	task followed by a repeated-checking task. Additionally, participants
	were asked to complete self-report questionnaires measuring OCD,
	anxiety and depression symptoms. RESULTS: Confirming our hypothesis,
	participants with poor inhibitory capabilities demonstrated greater
	uncertainty and memory distrust as a consequence of repeated checking
	than participants with good inhibitory control. LIMITATIONS: Our
	findings concern an initial investigation on a sample of healthy
	participants and should be replicated and extended to clinical populations.
	CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that deficits in inhibitory control
	may underlie cognitive vulnerability in OCD. An updated model integrating
	neuropsychological findings with current OCD models is suggested.},

	of using a model-based approach to the analysis and control of a
	basal ganglia (BG) network model of Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) spiking neurons
	through microstimulation. Detailed analysis of this network model
	suggests that it can reproduce the experimentally observed characteristics
	of BG neurons under a normal and a pathological Parkinsonian state.
	A simplified neuronal firing rate model, identified from the detailed
	HH network model, is shown to capture the essential network dynamics.
	Mathematical analysis of the simplified model reveals the presence
	of a systematic relationship between the network's structure and
	its dynamic response to spatiotemporally patterned microstimulation.
	We show that both the network synaptic organization and the local
	mechanism of microstimulation can impose tight constraints on the
	possible spatiotemporal firing patterns that can be generated by
	the microstimulated network, which may hinder the effectiveness of
	microstimulation to achieve a desired objective under certain conditions.
	Finally, we demonstrate that the feedback control design aided by
	the mathematical analysis of the simplified model is indeed effective
	in driving the BG network in the normal and Parskinsonian states
	to follow a prescribed spatiotemporal firing pattern. We further
	show that the rhythmic/oscillatory patterns that characterize a dopamine-depleted
	BG network can be suppressed as a direct consequence of controlling
	the spatiotemporal pattern of a subpopulation of the output Globus
	Pallidus internalis (GPi) neurons in the network. This work may provide
	plausible explanations for the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic
	effects of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in Parkinson's disease and
	pave the way towards a model-based, network level analysis and closed-loop
	control and optimization of DBS parameters, among many other applications.},

	response or to cancel a planned movement whenever needed. Such inhibitory
	control has been studied using the countermanding paradigm in which
	subjects are required to withhold an imminent movement when a stop
	signal appears infrequently in a fraction of trials. To elucidate
	the circuit mechanism of inhibitory control of action, we developed
	a recurrent network model consisting of spiking movement (GO) neurons
	and fixation (STOP) neurons, based on neurophysiological observations
	in the frontal eye field and superior colliculus of behaving monkeys.
	The model places a premium on the network dynamics before the onset
	of a stop signal, especially the experimentally observed high baseline
	activity of fixation neurons, which is assumed to be modulated by
	a persistent top-down control signal, and their synaptic interaction
	with movement neurons. The model simulated observed neural activity
	and fit behavioral performance quantitatively. In contrast to a race
	model in which the STOP process is initiated at the onset of a stop
	signal, in our model whether a movement will eventually be canceled
	is determined largely by the proactive top-down control and the stochastic
	network dynamics, even before the appearance of the stop signal.
	A prediction about the correlation between the fixation neural activity
	and the behavioral outcome was verified in the neurophysiological
	data recorded from behaving monkeys. The proposed mechanism for adjusting
	control through tonically active neurons that inhibit movement-producing
	neurons has significant implications for exploring the basis of impulsivity
	associated with psychiatric disorders.},

  abstract = {Stopping an initiated response is an essential function, investigated
	in many studies with go/no-go and stop-signal paradigms. These standard
	tests require rapid action cancellation. This appears to be achieved
	by a suppression mechanism that has "global" effects on corticomotor
	excitability (i.e., affecting task-irrelevant muscles). By contrast,
	stopping action in everyday life may require selectivity (i.e., targeting
	a specific response tendency without affecting concurrent action).
	We hypothesized that while standard stopping engages global suppression,
	behaviorally selective stopping engages a selective suppression mechanism.
	Accordingly, we measured corticomotor excitability of the task-irrelevant
	leg using transcranial magnetic stimulation while subjects stopped
	the hand. Experiment 1 showed that for standard (i.e., nonselective)
	stopping, the task-irrelevant leg was suppressed. Experiment 2 showed
	that for behaviorally selective stopping, there was no mean leg suppression.
	Experiment 3 directly compared behaviorally nonselective and selective
	stopping. Leg suppression occurred only in the behaviorally nonselective
	condition. These results argue that global and selective suppression
	mechanisms are dissociable. Participants may use a global suppression
	mechanism when speed is stressed; however, they may recruit a more
	selective suppression mechanism when selective stopping is behaviorally
	necessary and preparatory information is available. We predict that
	different fronto-basal-ganglia pathways underpin these different
	suppression mechanisms.},

	For all cue types, individual variability in response threshold was

	was found for repeat cues only. These findings support the notion
	that pre-SMA biases the striatum to lower response threshold under

	the formal computational processes underlying the generation of the

	we modeled the surprise associated with the occurrence of a visual
	stimulus to provide a formal quantification of the "subjective probability"
	associated with an event. Subjects performed a choice reaction time
	task, while we recorded their brain responses using electroencephalography
	(EEG). In each of 12 blocks, the probabilities of stimulus occurrence
	were changed, thereby creating sequences of trials with low, medium,
	and high predictability. Trial-by-trial variations in the P300 component
	were best explained by a model of stimulus-bound surprise. This model
	accounted for the data better than a categorical model that parametrically
	encoded the stimulus identity, or an alternative model of surprise
	based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence. The present data demonstrate
	that trial-by-trial changes in P300 can be explained by predictions
	made by an ideal observer keeping track of the probabilities of possible
	events. This provides evidence for theories proposing a direct link
	between the P300 component and the processing of surprising events.
	Furthermore, this study demonstrates how model-based analyses can

	Most studies of action selection have overlooked this fact, implicitly

	action planning in the context of an already present motor plan,
	but focused mostly on inhibition of a prepotent response under fierce

	Here, we explore how the presence of earlier motor plans influences

	that portions of parietofrontal circuits, including intraparietal
	sulcus and left dorsal premotor cortex, are systematically involved
	in programming motor responses, their activity being indifferent
	to the presence of earlier motor plans. We identify additional regions
	recruited when a motor response is programmed in the context of an
	existing motor program. We found that several right-hemisphere regions,
	previously associated with response inhibition, might be better characterized
	as involved in response selection. Finally, we detail the specific

  abstract = {Computational learning models are critical for understanding mechanisms
	of adaptive behavior. However, the two major current frameworks,
	reinforcement learning (RL) and Bayesian learning, both have certain
	limitations. For example, many Bayesian models are agnostic of inter-individual
	variability and involve complicated integrals, making online learning
	difficult. Here, we introduce a generic hierarchical Bayesian framework
	for individual learning under multiple forms of uncertainty (e.g.,
	environmental volatility and perceptual uncertainty). The model assumes
	Gaussian random walks of states at all but the first level, with
	the step size determined by the next highest level. The coupling
	between levels is controlled by parameters that shape the influence
	of uncertainty on learning in a subject-specific fashion. Using variational
	Bayes under a mean-field approximation and a novel approximation
	to the posterior energy function, we derive trial-by-trial update
	equations which (i) are analytical and extremely efficient, enabling
	real-time learning, (ii) have a natural interpretation in terms of
	RL, and (iii) contain parameters representing processes which play
	a key role in current theories of learning, e.g., precision-weighting
	of prediction error. These parameters allow for the expression of
	individual differences in learning and may relate to specific neuromodulatory
	mechanisms in the brain. Our model is very general: it can deal with
	both discrete and continuous states and equally accounts for deterministic
	and probabilistic relations between environmental events and perceptual
	states (i.e., situations with and without perceptual uncertainty).
	These properties are illustrated by simulations and analyses of empirical
	time series. Overall, our framework provides a novel foundation for
	understanding normal and pathological learning that contextualizes
	RL within a generic Bayesian scheme and thus connects it to principles
	of optimality from probability theory.},

  abstract = {1. Single-unit recordings were obtained from the subthalamic nuclei
	of three monkeys trained to perform a series of visuooculomotor tasks.
	The monkeys were trained to fixate on a spot of light on the screen
	(fixation task). When the spot was turned off and a target spot came
	on, they were required to fixate on the target quickly by making
	a saccade. Visually guided saccades were elicited when the target
	came on without a time gap (saccade task). Memory-guided saccades
	were elicited by delivering a brief cue stimulus while the monkey
	was fixating; after a delay, the fixation spot was turned off and
	the monkey made a saccade to the remembered target (delayed saccade
	task). 2. Of 265 neurons tested, 95 showed spike activity that was
	related to some aspects of the visuooculomotor tasks, whereas 66
	neurons responded to active or passive limb or body movements. The
	task-related activities were classified into the following categories:
	eye fixation-related, saccade-related, visual stimulus-related, target-
	and reward-related, and lever release-related. 3. Activity related
	to eye fixation (n = 22) consisted of a sustained spike discharge
	that occurred while the animal was fixating on a target light during
	the tasks. The activity increased after the animal started fixating
	on the target and abruptly ceased when the target went off. The activity
	was unrelated to eye position. It was not elicited during eye fixation
	outside the tasks. The activity decreased when the target spot was
	removed. 4. Activity related to saccades (n = 22) consisted of a
	phasic increase in spike frequency that was time locked with a saccade
	made during the tasks. The greatest increases occurred predominantly
	after saccade onset. This activity usually was unrelated to spontaneous
	saccades made outside the task. The changes in activity typically
	were optimal in one direction, generally toward the contralateral
	side. 5. Visual responses (n = 14) consisted of a phasic excitation
	in response to a visual probe stimulus or target. Response latencies
	usually were 70-120 ms. The receptive fields generally were centered
	in the contralateral hemifield, sometimes extending into the ipsilateral
	field. The receptive fields included the foveal region in seven neurons;
	most of these neurons responded best to parafoveal stimulation. Peripheral
	stimuli sometimes suppressed the activity of visually responsive
	neurons. 6. Activity related to target and reward (n = 29) consisted
	of sustained spike discharge that occurred only when the monkey could
	expect a reward by detecting the dimming of the light spot that he
	was fixating.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

	the reaction time of the Eriksen flanker task. In the task, subjects
	responded with finger flexion or extension to a central arrow while
	ignoring congruent or incongruent flanker arrows. Single-pulse transcranial
	magnetic stimulation (TMS) was applied over primary motor cortex
	(M1) at one of five different latencies after stimulus onset, and
	motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) were measured in the contralateral
	index finger. During the control (no flankers) and congruent conditions,
	MEP size in the agonist increased gradually over the course of reaction
	time, indicating an increase in corticospinal excitability. Conversely,
	when the same muscle acted as an antagonist, MEP size decreased,
	suggesting inhibition. Critically, in the incongruent condition,
	MEPs briefly increased in the muscle corresponding to an initial
	default response to the flanker arrows and were later replaced by
	MEPs corresponding to the correct response to the central arrow.
	Finally, we found that the gradually growing MEPs for the three conditions
	reached a constant maximum level just before movement initiation.
	We propose that this dynamic modulation in corticospinal excitability
	reflects the competition process, leading to the selection of one
	response and the rejection of the other. Our results suggest that
	response competition influences activity in primary motor cortex
	and that its timing directly influences motor output latency.},

	models of the basal ganglia-frontal system posit similar mechanisms
	for these deficits in terms of reduced dynamic range of striatal
	dopamine (DA) signals in both medicated and non-medicated states.
	Here, we report results from the first study that tests PD patients
	on and off dopaminergic medications in a modified version of the
	AX continuous performance (AX-CPT) working memory task, consisting
	of three performance phases and one phase requiring WM associations
	to be learned via reinforcement feedback. Patients generally showed
	impairments relative to controls. Medicated patients showed deficits
	specifically when having to ignore distracting stimuli during the
	delay. Our models suggest that this impairment is due to medication
	causing excessive WM updating by enhancing striatal "Go" signals
	that facilitate such updating, while concurrently suppressing "NoGo"
	signals. In contrast, patients off medication showed deficits consistent
	with an overall reduction in striatal DA and associated Go updating
	signals. Supporting this dichotomy, patients on and off medication
	both showed attentional shifting deficits, but for different reasons.
	Deficits in non-medicated patients were consistent with an inability
	to update the new attentional set, whereas those in medicated patients
	were evident when having to ignore distractors that had previously
	been task relevant. Finally, in the feedback-based WM phase, medicated
	patients were better than unmedicated patients, suggesting a key
	role of striatal DA in using feedback to update information into
	WM. These results lend further insight into the role of basal ganglia
	dopamine in WM and broadly support predictions from neurocomputational
	models.},

	subjects experiencing shocks under dopamine blockade, and hence failing
	to avoid them, nevertheless develop avoidance responses when both
	shocks and dopamine blockade are subsequently removed. These postulated

	habituation is also known to occur on the behavioral level, manifested

	stimuli. It is, however, not clear which brain areas show a decline
	in activity during repeated sensory stimulation on the same time
	scale as reduced valence and arousal experience and whether these
	areas can be delineated from other brain areas with habituation effects
	on faster or slower time scales. These questions were addressed using
	functional magnetic resonance imaging acquired during repeated stimulation
	with piano melodies. The magnitude of functional responses in the
	laterobasal amygdala and in related cortical areas and that of valence
	and arousal ratings, given after each music presentation, declined
	in parallel over the experiment. In contrast to this long-term habituation
	(43 min), short-term decreases occurring within seconds were found
	in the primary auditory cortex. Sustained responses that remained
	throughout the whole investigated time period were detected in the
	ventrolateral prefrontal cortex extending to the dorsal part of the

	It has been argued that they "inhibit" habitual motor responses when
	environmental changes mean a different response should be made. However,
	whether such "inhibition" can be equated with inhibitory physiological
	interactions has been unclear, as has the areas' relationship with
	each other and the anatomical routes by which they influence movement
	execution. Paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (ppTMS)
	was applied over rIFG and primary motor cortex (M1) or over pre-SMA
	and M1 to measure their interactions, at a subsecond scale, during
	either inhibition and reprogramming of actions or during routine
	action selection. Distinct patterns of functional interaction between
	pre-SMA and M1 and between rIFG and M1 were found that were specific
	to action reprogramming trials; at a physiological level, direct
	influences of pre-SMA and rIFG on M1 were predominantly facilitatory
	and inhibitory, respectively. In a subsequent experiment, it was
	shown that the rIFG's inhibitory influence was dependent on pre-SMA.
	A third experiment showed that pre-SMA and rIFG influenced M1 at
	two time scales. By regressing white matter fractional anisotropy
	from diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images against TMS-measured
	functional connectivity, it was shown that short-latency (6 ms) and
	longer latency (12 ms) influences were mediated by cortico-cortical
	and subcortical pathways, respectively, with the latter passing close

  abstract = {There is a glaring gap in the psychiatric literature concerning the
	nature of psychiatric symptoms and signs, and a corresponding lack
	of epistemological discussion of psycho-diagnostic interviewing.
	Contemporary clinical neuroscience heavily relies on the use of fully
	structured interviews that are historically rooted in logical positivism
	and behaviorism. These theoretical approaches marked decisively the
	so-called "operational revolution in psychiatry" leading to the creation
	of DSM-III. This paper attempts to examine the theoretical assumptions
	that underlie the use of a fully structured psychiatric interview.
	We address the ontological status of pathological experience, the
	notions of symptom, sign, prototype and Gestalt, and the necessary
	second-person processes which are involved in converting the patient's
	experience (originally lived in the first-person perspective) into
	an "objective" (third person), actionable format, used for classification,
	treatment, and research. Our central thesis is that psychiatry targets
	the phenomena of consciousness, which, unlike somatic symptoms and
	signs, cannot be grasped on the analogy with material thing-like
	objects. We claim that in order to perform faithful distinctions
	in this particular domain, we need a more adequate approach, that
	is, an approach that is guided by phenomenologically informed considerations.
	Our theoretical discussion draws upon clinical examples derived from
	structured and semi-structured interviews. We conclude that fully
	structured interview is neither theoretically adequate nor practically
	valid in obtaining psycho-diagnostic information. Failure to address
	these basic issues may have contributed to the current state of malaise

	greater difficulty in suppressing prepotent or habitual responses
	on the Stroop, Hayling and random number generation tasks relative

	Our Bayesian approach also quantifies the confidence with which each

	its utility in effort assessment to that of the classic below-chance
	criterion of symptom validity testing (SVT). In two experiments,

	a simulation research design, whereas Experiment 2 involves the differentiation
	of patients with a history of stroke from coached malingerers. In
	both experiments, sensitivity levels are high for the Bayesian method,

	that integrate success and failure to improve future decisions. One
	computational solution consists of updating the value of choices
	in proportion to reward prediction errors, which are potentially
	encoded in dopamine signals. Accordingly, drugs that modulate dopamine
	transmission were shown to impact instrumental learning performance.
	However, whether these drugs act on conscious or subconscious learning
	processes remains unclear. To address this issue, we examined the
	effects of dopamine-related medications in a subliminal instrumental
	learning paradigm. To assess generality of dopamine implication,
	we tested both dopamine enhancers in Parkinson's disease (PD) and
	dopamine blockers in Tourette's syndrome (TS). During the task, patients
	had to learn from monetary outcomes the expected value of a risky
	choice. The different outcomes (rewards and punishments) were announced
	by visual cues, which were masked such that patients could not consciously
	perceive them. Boosting dopamine transmission in PD patients improved
	reward learning but worsened punishment avoidance. Conversely, blocking
	dopamine transmission in TS patients favored punishment avoidance
	but impaired reward seeking. These results thus extend previous findings
	in PD to subliminal situations and to another pathological condition,
	TS. More generally, they suggest that pharmacological manipulation
	of dopamine transmission can subconsciously drive us to either get
	more rewards or avoid more punishments.},

	task to manipulate the probability that, after the presentation of
	a stop signal, the monkeys canceled a saccade that was planned in
	response to an eccentric visual stimulus. By modeling each animal's
	behavioral responses, with a race between GO and STOP processes leading
	up to either saccade initiation or cancellation, we estimated that
	saccade cancellation took on average 110 msec. Neurons recorded in
	the superior colliculus intermediate layers during this task exhibited
	the discharge properties expected from neurons closely involved in
	behavioral control. Both saccade- and fixation-related discharged
	differently when saccades were counter-manded instead of executed,
	and the time at which they changed their activity preceded the behavioral
	estimate of saccade cancellation obtained from the same trials by
	10 and 13 msec, respectively. Furthermore, these intervals exceed
	the minimal amount of time needed for SC activity to influence eye
	movements. The additional observation that saccade-related neurons
	discharged significantly less when saccades were countermanded instead
	of executed suggests that saccades are triggered when these neurons
	reach a critical activation level. Altogether, these findings provide
	solid evidence that the superior colliculus contains the necessary
	neural signals to be directly involved in the decision process that
	regulates whether a saccade is to be produced.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Methylphenidate improves motor response inhibition, typically
	assessed with the stop-signal task. The exact underlying mechanism

	that stop signals can have a confounding attentional-capture effect
	because of their low frequency in the task. In the current study,
	we assessed the effects of methylphenidate on neural networks of
	inhibitory control and attentional-capture within the context of
	two inhibitory control tasks. METHODS: The effects of methylphenidate
	(40 mg) were assessed using functional magnetic resonance imaging
	in 16 healthy volunteers in a within-subject, double-blind, placebo-controlled
	design. RESULTS: Methylphenidate significantly reduced activation
	of different regions within the right inferior frontal gyrus/insula
	to infrequent stimuli associated with successful inhibition, failed
	inhibition, and attentional capture. These inferior frontal gyrus
	regions showed different interregional connections with inhibitory
	and attention networks. For failed inhibitions, methylphenidate increased
	activation within performance-monitoring regions, including the superior
	frontal, anterior cingulate, and parietal-occipital cortices, but
	only after controlling for attentional capture. CONCLUSIONS: Our
	findings suggest that the improvement of response inhibition seen

  abstract = {Numerous studies have established a role for the ACC in cognitive
	control. Current theories are at odds as to whether ACC itself directly
	engages or alternatively recruits other frontal cortical areas that
	implement control. The antisaccade task, in which subjects are required
	to make a saccade to the location opposite a suddenly appearing visual
	stimulus, is a simple oculomotor paradigm that has been used extensively
	to investigate flexible oculomotor control. Here, we tested a causal
	role of the dorsal ACC in cognitive control by applying electrical
	microstimulation during a preparatory period while monkeys performed
	alternating blocks of pro- and antisaccade trials. Microstimulation
	induced significant changes in saccadic RTs (SRTs) in both tasks.
	On prosaccade trials, SRTs were increased for saccades contralateral
	to and decreased for saccades ipsilateral to the stimulated hemisphere.
	In contrast, SRTs were decreased for both ipsi- and contralaterally
	directed antisaccades. These data show that microstimulation administered
	during response preparation facilitated the performance of antisaccades
	and are suggestive of a direct role of ACC in the implementation
	of cognitive control.},

	for a group of Ss. The method is particularly useful for cases in
	which data from many Ss are available but there are only 10–20
	RT observations per S cell. Essentially, RTs for each S are organized
	in ascending order, and quantiles are calculated. The quantiles are
	then averaged over Ss to give group quantiles (Vincent learning curves).
	From the group quantiles, a group RT distribution can be constructed.
	It is shown that this method of averaging is exact for certain distributions
	(i.e., the resulting distribution belongs to the same family as the
	individual distributions). Furthermore, Monte Carlo studies and application
	of the method to the combined data from 3 large experiments provide
	evidence that properties derived from the group RT distribution are
	much the same as average properties derived from the data of individual
	Ss. This article also examines how to quantitatively describe the
	shape of RT distributions. The use of moments and cumulants as sources
	of information about distribution shape is evaluated and rejected
	because of extreme dependence on long, outlier reaction times. As
	an alternative, the use of explicit distribution functions as approximations
	to RT distributions is considered. (28 ref) }

  month = nov,
  abstract = {In their influential Psychological Review article, Bogacz, Brown,
	Moehlis, Holmes, and Cohen (2006) discussed optimal decision making
	as accomplished by the drift diffusion model (DDM). The authors showed
	that neural inhibition models, such as the leaky competing accumulator
	model (LCA) and the feedforward inhibition model (FFI), can mimic
	the DDM and accomplish optimal decision making. Here we show that
	these conclusions depend on how the models handle negative activation
	values and (for the LCA) across-trial variability in response conservativeness.
	Negative neural activations are undesirable for both neurophysiological
	and mathematical reasons. However, when negative activations are
	truncated to 0, the equivalence to the DDM is lost. Simulations show
	that this concern has practical ramifications: The DDM generally
	outperforms truncated versions of the LCA and the FFI, and the parameter

  journal = {Neuroscience},
  year = {2011},
  month = jul,
  abstract = {Multifunctional agents with limited motor resources must decide what
	actions will best ensure their survival. Moreover, given that in
	an unpredictable world things don't always work out, considerable
	advantage is to be gained by learning from experience - instrumental
	behaviour that maximises reward and minimises punishment. In this
	review we will argue that the re-entrant looped architecture of the
	basal ganglia represents biological solutions to these fundamental
	behavioural problems of selection and reinforcement. A potential
	solution to the selection problem is provided for by selective disinhibition
	within the parallel loop architecture that connects the basal ganglia
	with external neural structures. The relay points within these loops
	permit the signals of a particular channel to be modified by external
	influences. In part, these influences have the capacity to modify
	overall selections so that the probability of re-selecting reinforced
	behaviours in the future is altered. This is the basic process of
	instrumental learning, which we suggest decomposes into two sub-problems
	for the agent: (i) learning which external events it causes to happen
	and learning precisely what it is doing that is causal; and (ii)
	having determined agency and discovered novel action-outcome routines,
	how best to exploit this knowledge to maximise future reward acquisitions.
	Considerations of connectional architecture and signal timing suggest
	that the short-latency, sensory-evoked dopamine response, which can
	modulate the re-entrant loop structure within the basal ganglia,
	is ideally suited to reinforce the determination of agency and the
	discovery of novel actions. Alternatively, recent studies showing
	that presence or absence of reward can selectively modulate the magnitude
	of signals in structures providing input signals to the basal ganglia,
	offer an alternative mechanism for biasing selection within the re-entrant
	loop architecture. We suggest that this mechanism may be better suited
	to ensure the prioritisation of inputs associated with reward.},

	Young and older adults were asked to direct their eyes to a target

	that saccades to the target object were disrupted by the appearance
	of a task-irrelevant abrupt-onset distractor when the location of
	this distractor did not coincide with that of the target object.
	Conditional capture function analyses revealed that, compared to
	young adults, older adults were more susceptible to oculomotor capture,
	and exhibited deficient selective suppression of the responses captured
	by task-irrelevant distractors. These effects were uncorrelated,
	suggesting two independent sources off age-related decline. Thus,
	with advancing age, salient visual distractors become more distracting;
	in part because they trigger reflexive eye-movements more potently;
	in part because of failing top-down control over such reflexes. The

	hypothesis, we recorded from neurons in SMA and pre-SMA of monkeys

	activity is sufficient to control movement initiation or inhibition.
	Surprisingly, 99\% (242 of 243) of movement-related neurons in SMA

	of movement initiation in this task. We also found a second group
	of neurons that was more active during successful response cancelation.
	Of these putative inhibitory cells, 18\% (7 of 40) responded early
	enough to be able to influence the cancelation of the movement. Thus,
	when tested with the countermanding task, the SMA/pre-SMA region
	may play a role in movement inhibition but does not appear to control
	movement initiation. However, the activity of 76\% (202 of 267) of

	and 42\% of them reflected the amount of expected reward. These findings
	suggest that the movement-related activity in pre-SMA and SMA might

  abstract = {Many theories of human cognition postulate that people are equipped
	with a repertoire of strategies to solve the tasks they face. This
	theoretical framework of a cognitive toolbox provides a plausible
	account of intra- and interindividual differences in human behavior.
	Unfortunately, it is often unclear how to rigorously test the toolbox
	framework. How can a toolbox model be quantitatively specified? How
	can the number of toolbox strategies be limited to prevent uncontrolled
	strategy sprawl? How can a toolbox model be formally tested against
	alternative theories? The authors show how these challenges can be
	met by using Bayesian inference techniques. By means of parameter
	recovery simulations and the analysis of empirical data across a
	variety of domains (i.e., judgment and decision making, children's
	cognitive development, function learning, and perceptual categorization),
	the authors illustrate how Bayesian inference techniques allow toolbox
	models to be quantitatively specified, strategy sprawl to be contained,
	and toolbox models to be rigorously tested against competing theories.
	The authors demonstrate that their approach applies at the individual
	level but can also be generalized to the group level with hierarchical

	rats. Experiments 3 and 4 found that pre-training striatal lesions
	had no effect on compulsive lever-pressing, whereas post-training

	system, which is manifested in compulsive behavior, and that antiobsessional/anticompulsive
	drugs exerts their effects, in these patients, by normalizing the

	eye movements specified by abstract instructions, as well as the
	ability to repress unwanted orientating to sudden stimuli. Both of
	these abilities are challenged in the antisaccade task, because it
	requires subjects to look at an unmarked location opposite to a flashed
	stimulus, without glancing at it. Performance on this task depends
	on the frontal/prefrontal cortex and related structures, but the
	neuronal operations underlying antisaccades are not understood. It
	is not known, for example, how excited visual neurons that normally
	trigger a saccade to a target (a prosaccade) can activate oculomotor
	neurons directing gaze in the opposite direction. Visual neurons
	might, perhaps, alter their receptive fields depending on whether
	they receive a pro- or antisaccade instruction. If the receptive
	field is not altered, the antisaccade goal must be computed and imposed
	from the top down to the appropriate oculomotor neurons. Here we
	show, using recordings from the supplementary eye field (a frontal
	cortex oculomotor centre) in monkeys, that visual and movement neurons
	retain the same spatial selectivity across randomly mixed pro- and
	antisaccade trials. However, these neurons consistently fire more
	before antisaccades than prosaccades with the same trajectories,
	suggesting a mechanism through which voluntary antisaccade commands
	can override reflexive glances.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Recent anatomical-functional studies have transformed
	our understanding of cerebral motor control away from a hierarchical
	structure and toward parallel and interconnected specialized circuits.
	Subcortical electrical stimulation during awake surgery provides
	a unique opportunity to identify white matter tracts involved in
	motor control. For the first time, this study reports the findings
	on motor modulatory responses evoked by subcortical stimulation and
	investigates the cortico-subcortical connectivity of cerebral motor
	control. Experimental design: Twenty-one selected patients were operated
	while awake for frontal, insular, and parietal diffuse low-grade
	gliomas. Subcortical electrostimulation mapping was used to search
	for interference with voluntary movements. The corresponding stimulation
	sites were localized on brain schemas using the anterior and posterior
	commissures method. Principal observations: Subcortical negative
	motor responses were evoked in 20/21 patients, whereas acceleration
	of voluntary movements and positive motor responses were observed
	in three and five patients, respectively. The majority of the stimulation
	sites were detected rostral of the corticospinal tract near the vertical
	anterior-commissural line, and additional sites were seen in the
	frontal and parietal white matter. Conclusions: The diverse interferences
	with motor function resulting in inhibition and acceleration imply
	a modulatory influence of the detected fiber network. The subcortical
	stimulation sites were distributed veil-like, anterior to the primary
	motor fibers, suggesting descending pathways originating from premotor
	areas known for negative motor response characteristics. Further
	stimulation sites in the parietal white matter as well as in the
	anterior arm of the internal capsule indicate a large-scale fronto-parietal
	motor control network. Hum Brain Mapp, 2012. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals,

	that the event is attended to, and that the action is inhibited.
	Previous neuroimaging investigations of stopping have failed to adequately
	separate these cognitive elements. Here we used a version of the
	widely used Stop Signal Task that controls for the attentional capture
	of stop signals. This allowed us to fractionate the contributions
	of frontal regions, including the right inferior frontal gyrus and
	medial frontal cortex, to attentional capture, response inhibition,
	and error processing. A ventral attentional system, including the
	right inferior frontal gyrus, has been shown to respond to unexpected
	stimuli. In line with this evidence, we reasoned that lateral frontal
	regions support attentional capture, whereas medial frontal regions,
	including the presupplementary motor area (pre-SMA), actually inhibit
	the ongoing action. We tested this hypothesis by contrasting the
	brain networks associated with the presentation of unexpected stimuli
	against those associated with outright stopping. Functional MRI images
	were obtained in 26 healthy volunteers. Successful stopping was associated
	with activation of the right inferior frontal gyrus, as well as the
	pre-SMA. However, only activation of the pre-SMA differentiated stopping
	from a high-level baseline that controlled for attentional capture.
	As expected, unsuccessful attempts at stopping activated the anterior
	cingulate cortex. In keeping with work in nonhuman primates these
	findings demonstrate that successful motor inhibition is specifically
	associated with pre-SMA activation.},

	the ability to dynamically modify or cancel planned actions in response
	to changes in the sensory environment or task demands. We formulate
	a probabilistic, rational decision-making framework for inhibitory
	control in the stop signal paradigm. Our model posits that subjects
	maintain a Bayes-optimal, continually updated representation of sensory
	inputs, and repeatedly assess the relative value of stopping and
	going on a fine temporal scale, in order to make an optimal decision
	on when and whether to go on each trial. We further posit that they

	function capturing the various reward and penalties associated with
	different behavioral outcomes, such as speed and accuracy, or the
	relative costs of stop errors and go errors. We demonstrate that
	our rational decision-making model naturally gives rise to basic
	behavioral characteristics consistently observed for this paradigm,
	as well as more subtle effects due to contextual factors such as
	reward contingencies or motivational factors. Furthermore, we show
	that the classical race model can be seen as a computationally simpler,
	perhaps neurally plausible, approximation to optimal decision-making.
	This conceptual link allows us to predict how the parameters of the

  year = {2012},
  pages = {1--12},
  month = jun,
  abstract = {Machine learning algorithms frequently require careful tuning of model
	hyperparameters, regularization terms, and optimization parameters.
	Unfortunately, this tuning is often a "black art" that requires expert
	experience, unwritten rules of thumb, or sometimes brute-force search.
	Much more appealing is the idea of developing automatic approaches
	which can optimize the performance of a given learning algorithm
	to the task at hand. In this work, we consider the automatic tuning
	problem within the framework of Bayesian optimization, in which a
	learning algorithm's generalization performance is modeled as a sample
	from a Gaussian process (GP). The tractable posterior distribution
	induced by the GP leads to efficient use of the information gathered
	by previous experiments, enabling optimal choices about what parameters
	to try next. Here we show how the effects of the Gaussian process
	prior and the associated inference procedure can have a large impact
	on the success or failure of Bayesian optimization. We show that
	thoughtful choices can lead to results that exceed expert-level performance
	in tuning machine learning algorithms. We also describe new algorithms
	that take into account the variable cost (duration) of learning experiments

  abstract = {Each of our movements activates our own sensory receptors, and therefore
	keeping track of self-movement is a necessary part of analysing sensory
	input. One way in which the brain keeps track of self-movement is
	by monitoring an internal copy, or corollary discharge, of motor
	commands. This concept could explain why we perceive a stable visual
	world despite our frequent quick, or saccadic, eye movements: corollary
	discharge about each saccade would permit the visual system to ignore
	saccade-induced visual changes. The critical missing link has been
	the connection between corollary discharge and visual processing.
	Here we show that such a link is formed by a corollary discharge
	from the thalamus that targets the frontal cortex. In the thalamus,
	neurons in the mediodorsal nucleus relay a corollary discharge of
	saccades from the midbrain superior colliculus to the cortical frontal
	eye field. In the frontal eye field, neurons use corollary discharge
	to shift their visual receptive fields spatially before saccades.
	We tested the hypothesis that these two components-a pathway for
	corollary discharge and neurons with shifting receptive fields-form
	a circuit in which the corollary discharge drives the shift. First
	we showed that the known spatial and temporal properties of the corollary
	discharge predict the dynamic changes in spatial visual processing
	of cortical neurons when saccades are made. Then we moved from this
	correlation to causation by isolating single cortical neurons and
	showing that their spatial visual processing is impaired when corollary
	discharge from the thalamus is interrupted. Thus the visual processing
	of frontal neurons is spatiotemporally matched with, and functionally
	dependent on, corollary discharge input from the thalamus. These
	experiments establish the first link between corollary discharge
	and visual processing, delineate a brain circuit that is well suited
	for mediating visual stability, and provide a framework for studying
	corollary discharge in other sensory systems.},

	through an ascending pathway coursing from the superior colliculus

	Using antidromic and orthodromic stimulation, we identified SC source
	neurons, MD relay neurons, and FEF recipient neurons of the pathway

	delayed-saccade tasks, that permitted analysis of signals such as
	visual activity, delay activity, and presaccadic activity. We found
	that the SC sends all of these signals into the pathway with no output
	selectivity, i.e., the signals leaving the SC resembled those found
	generally within the SC. Visual activity arrived in FEF too late
	to contribute to short-latency visual responses there, and delay
	activity was largely filtered out in MD. Presaccadic activity, however,
	seemed critical because it traveled essentially unchanged from SC
	to FEF. Signal transmission in the pathway was fast ( approximately
	2 ms from SC to FEF) and topographically organized (SC neurons drove
	MD and FEF neurons having similarly eccentric visual and movement
	fields). Our analysis of identified neurons in one pathway from brain
	stem to frontal cortex thus demonstrates that multiple signals are

	of first saccades should disrupt second saccades. We found, first,
	that monkeys seemed to misjudge the amplitudes of their first saccades;
	this was revealed by systematic shifts in second saccade end points.
	Thus corollary discharge accuracy was impaired. Second, monkeys were
	less able to detect trial-by-trial variations in their first saccades;
	this was revealed by reduced compensatory changes in second saccade
	angles. Thus corollary discharge precision also was impaired. Both
	deficits occurred only when first saccades went into the contralateral

  abstract = {Bayesian model selection (BMS) is a powerful method for determining
	the most likely among a set of competing hypotheses about the mechanisms
	that generated observed data. BMS has recently found widespread application
	in neuroimaging, particularly in the context of dynamic causal modelling
	(DCM). However, so far, combining BMS results from several subjects
	has relied on simple (fixed effects) metrics, e.g. the group Bayes
	factor (GBF), that do not account for group heterogeneity or outliers.
	In this paper, we compare the GBF with two random effects methods
	for BMS at the between-subject or group level. These methods provide
	inference on model-space using a classical and Bayesian perspective
	respectively. First, a classical (frequentist) approach uses the
	log model evidence as a subject-specific summary statistic. This
	enables one to use analysis of variance to test for differences in
	log-evidences over models, relative to inter-subject differences.
	We then consider the same problem in Bayesian terms and describe
	a novel hierarchical model, which is optimised to furnish a probability
	density on the models themselves. This new variational Bayes method
	rests on treating the model as a random variable and estimating the
	parameters of a Dirichlet distribution which describes the probabilities
	for all models considered. These probabilities then define a multinomial
	distribution over model space, allowing one to compute how likely
	it is that a specific model generated the data of a randomly chosen
	subject as well as the exceedance probability of one model being
	more likely than any other model. Using empirical and synthetic data,
	we show that optimising a conditional density of the model probabilities,
	given the log-evidences for each model over subjects, is more informative
	and appropriate than both the GBF and frequentist tests of the log-evidences.
	In particular, we found that the hierarchical Bayesian approach is
	considerably more robust than either of the other approaches in the
	presence of outliers. We expect that this new random effects method
	will prove useful for a wide range of group studies, not only in
	the context of DCM, but also for other modelling endeavours, e.g.
	comparing different source reconstruction methods for EEG/MEG or
	selecting among competing computational models of learning and decision-making.},

	increase the discharge rate before saccade initiation. However, when
	saccades are canceled in response to a stop signal, effectively no
	neurons with presaccadic activity display discharge rate modulation
	early enough to contribute to saccade cancellation. Moreover, SEF
	neurons do not exhibit a specific threshold discharge rate that could
	trigger saccade initiation. Yet, we observed more subtle relations
	between SEF activation and saccade production. The activity of numerous
	SEF neurons was correlated with response time and varied with sequential
	adjustments in response latency. Trials in which monkeys canceled
	or produced a saccade in a stop signal trial were distinguished by

	In humans, the medial frontal cortex has been implicated in the supervisory

	circuit, including the right inferior frontal cortex (rIFC) and the
	subthalamic nucleus (STN). Intracranial recording studies in humans
	reveal an increase in beta-band power (approximately 16-20 Hz) within
	the rIFC and STN when a response is stopped. This suggests that the
	beta-band could be important for communication in this network. If
	this is the case, then altering one region should affect the electrophysiological
	response at the other. We addressed this hypothesis by recording
	scalp EEG during a stop task while modulating STN activity with deep
	brain stimulation. We studied 15 human patients with Parkinson's
	disease and 15 matched healthy control subjects. Behaviorally, patients
	OFF stimulation were slower than controls to stop their response.
	Moreover, stopping speed was improved for ON compared to OFF stimulation.
	For scalp EEG, there was greater beta power, around the time of stopping,
	for patients ON compared to OFF stimulation. This effect was stronger
	over the right compared to left frontal cortex, consistent with the
	putative right lateralization of the stopping network. Thus, deep
	brain stimulation of the STN improved behavioral stopping performance
	and increased the beta-band response over the right frontal cortex.
	These results complement other evidence for a structurally connected
	functional circuit between right frontal cortex and the basal ganglia.
	The results also suggest that deep brain stimulation of the STN may
	improve task performance by increasing the fidelity of information
	transfer within a fronto-basal-ganglia circuit.},

	the functional role of two regions in this putative stopping network,
	the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and the primary motor cortex
	(M1), using electocorticography from subdural electrodes in four
	patients while they performed a stop-signal task. On each trial,
	a motor response was initiated, and on a minority of trials a stop
	signal instructed the patient to try to stop the response. For each
	patient, there was a greater right IFG response in the beta frequency
	band ( approximately 16 Hz) for successful versus unsuccessful stop
	trials. This finding adds to evidence for a functional network for
	stopping because changes in beta frequency activity have also been
	observed in the basal ganglia in association with behavioral stopping.
	In addition, the right IFG response occurred 100-250 ms after the
	stop signal, a time range consistent with a putative inhibitory control
	process rather than with stop-signal processing or feedback regarding
	success. A downstream target of inhibitory control is M1. In each
	patient, there was alpha/beta band desynchronization in M1 for stop
	trials. However, the degree of desynchronization in M1 was less for
	successfully than unsuccessfully stopped trials. This reduced desynchronization
	on successful stop trials could relate to increased GABA inhibition
	in M1. Together with other findings, the results suggest that behavioral
	stopping is implemented via synchronized activity in the beta frequency
	band in a right IFG/basal ganglia network, with downstream effects

	resolution of electrocorticography (ECoG), and by using a task that
	engages both preparing to stop and stopping outright. First, we validated
	the task using fMRI in 16 healthy control participants to confirm
	that both the preSMA and the rIFG were active. Next, we studied a
	rare patient with intracranial grid coverage of both these regions,
	using macrostimulation, diffusion tractography, cortico-cortical

	revealed a structural connection between the preSMA and rIFG. CCEP
	analysis showed that stimulation of the preSMA evoked strong potentials

	was increased high gamma amplitude (\~{}70-250Hz) in both regions,

	(SMA) were obtained once every second, using an echoplanar 1.5 tesla

	sec). The subject performed a single motor trial (i.e., relaxation
	or contraction) during one session in his own time. Ten sessions
	were done for each task. During fMRI scanning, electromyogram (EMG)
	was monitored from the right forearm muscles to identify the motor
	onset. We calculated the correlation between the obtained fMRI signal
	and the expected hemodynamic response. The muscle relaxation showed
	transient signal increase time-locked to the EMG offset in the M1
	contralateral to the movement and bilateral SMAs, where activation
	was observed also in the muscle contraction. Activated volume in

	The results suggest that voluntary muscle relaxation occurs as a

	THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THIS PROCESSING MAY TAKE DIFFERENT FORMS AND
	MAY HAVE DIFFERENT EFFECTS, DEPENDING ON THE TASK AT HAND: (1) it
	may facilitate fast and accurate responding, or (2) it may cause
	slow responding when prolonged elaborate processing is required to
	increase accuracy of responding, or (3) it may interfere with accuracy
	and speed of next-trial (for instance, post-error) performance when
	prolonged elaborate processing interferes with processing of the
	next stimulus. We present our viewpoint that ventrolateral corticolimbic
	control pathways, including the IFG/AI, and mediodorsal corticolimbic
	control pathways, including dorsal anterior cingulate cortex areas,
	play partly separable, but interacting roles in adaptive behavior
	in environmental conditions that differ in the level of predictability:
	compared to dorsal feed-forward control, the ventral corticolimbic
	control pathways implement control over actions through higher responsiveness
	to momentary environmental stimuli. This latter control mode is associated
	with an attentional focus on stimuli that are urgent or close in
	time and space, while the former control mode is associated with
	a broader, more global focus in time and space. Both control pathways
	have developed extensively through evolution, and both developed
	their own "cognitive controls," such that neither one can be properly
	described as purely "cognitive" or "emotional." We discuss literature
	that suggests that the role of IFG/AI in top-down control is reflected
	in cortical rhythms and event-related potentials. Together, the literature
	suggests that the IFG/AI is an important node in brain networks that

	combining techniques used to measure behavior and brain activity
	with neural modeling. Here we apply this approach to the initiation
	of rapid eye movements (saccades), which are used to redirect the
	visual axis to targets of interest. It is well known that the superior
	colliculus (SC) in the midbrain plays a major role in generating
	saccadic eye movements, and physiological studies have provided important
	knowledge of the activity pattern of neurons in this structure. Based
	on the observation that the SC receives localized sensory (exogenous)
	and voluntary (endogenous) inputs, our model assumes that this information
	is integrated by dynamic competition across local collicular interactions.
	The model accounts well for the effects upon saccadic reaction time
	(SRT) due to removal of fixation, the presence of distractors, execution
	of pro- versus antisaccades, and variation in target probability,
	and suggests a possible mechanism for the generation of express saccades.
	In each of these cases, the activity patterns of "neurons" within
	the model closely resemble actual cell behavior in the intermediate
	layer of the SC. The interaction structure we employ is instrumental
	for producing a physiologically faithful model and results in new
	insights and hypotheses regarding the neural mechanisms underlying

	cortex regions to enable their function in performance monitoring.
	So far, direct evidence is missing, however. We addressed the involvement

	event-related brain potentials (ERPs) and behavioral data in nine
	patients with focal basal ganglia lesions and seven patients with
	lateral prefrontal cortex lesions while they performed a flanker

	prefrontal cortex patients whose lesions extended into the frontal
	white matter, disrupting the connections to the motor anterior cingulate

	In sum, the fronto-striato-thalamo-cortical circuits seem necessary

	in the mouse, a species suited for transgenic studies, the mechanisms
	of locomotor sensitization showed by the increased response to a
	second injection of drug (two-injection protocol of sensitization,
	TIPS). The first cocaine injection induced a locomotor sensitization
	that was completely context-dependent, increased during the first
	week, and persisted 3 months later. The induction of sensitized responses
	to cocaine required dopamine D1 and glutamate NMDA receptors. A single
	injection of the selective dopamine transporter blocker GBR12783
	was sufficient to activate extracellular signal-regulated kinase
	(ERK) in the striatum to the same level as cocaine and to induce
	sensitization to cocaine, but not to itself. The induction of sensitization
	was sensitive to protein synthesis inhibition by anisomycin after
	cocaine administration. Morphine induced a pronounced context-dependent
	sensitization that crossed with cocaine. Sensitization to morphine
	injection was prevented in knockin mutant mice bearing a Thr-34-Ala
	mutation of DARPP-32, which suppresses its ability to inhibit protein
	phosphatase-1 (PP1), but not mutation of Thr-75 or Ser-130. These
	results combined with previous ones show that TIPS in mouse is a
	context-dependent response, which involves an increase in extracellular
	dopamine, stimulation of D1 and NMDA receptors, regulation of the
	cAMP-dependent and ERK pathways, inhibition of PP1, and protein synthesis.

	Selective stimulation of serotonergic median raphe neurons produced
	a rapid activation of hippocampal interneurons. At the network level,
	this subcortical drive was manifested as a pattern of effective disynaptic
	GABAergic inhibition that spread throughout the circuit. This form

	concepts of normal and pathological cortical function.},

	cognitive dysfunction is a persistent issue that impairs quality

	Recent interest in non-DA substrates of PD highlights early involvement
	of LC-NE neurons and provides evidence for a prodromal phase, with

	basic research in LC-NE function to clinical and pathological evidence
	highlighting a role for NE in PD cognitive dysfunction. We propose
	that loss of LC-NE regulation, particularly in higher cortical regions,
	critically underlies certain cognitive dysfunctions in early PD.

	in PD may provide significant benefits for cognitive processing.},

	Retrogradely labeled cells in the PF were plotted with an automated

	mainly distributed in the upper and lower banks of the principal
	sulcus (area 46), with little overlap. Cells projecting to the SEF,
	but not to the pre-SMA, were observed in areas 8a, 8b, 9, 12, and
	45. These findings suggest that the SEF and pre-SMA receive different

  abstract = {The basal ganglia (BG) are a group of subcortical structures involved
	in diverse functions, such as motor, cognition and emotion. However,
	the BG do not control these functions directly, but rather modulate
	functional processes occurring in structures outside the BG. The
	BG form multiple functional loops, each of which controls different
	functions with similar architectures. Accordingly, to understand
	the modulatory role of the BG, it is strategic to uncover the mechanisms
	of signal processing within specific functional loops that control
	simple neural circuits outside the BG, and then extend the knowledge
	to other BG loops. The saccade control system is one of the best-understood
	neural circuits in the brain. Furthermore, sophisticated saccade
	paradigms have been used extensively in clinical research in patients
	with BG disorders as well as in basic research in behaving monkeys.
	In this review, we describe recent advances of BG research from the
	viewpoint of saccade control. Specifically, we account for experimental
	results from neuroimaging and clinical studies in humans based on
	the updated knowledge of BG functions derived from neurophysiological
	experiments in behaving monkeys by taking advantage of homologies
	in saccade behavior. It has become clear that the traditional BG
	network model for saccade control is too limited to account for recent
	evidence emerging from the roles of subcortical nuclei not incorporated
	in the model. Here, we extend the traditional model and propose a
	new hypothetical framework to facilitate clinical and basic BG research
	and dialogue in the future.},

	The reaction times of contralateral saccades were prolonged on both
	prosaccade and antisaccade trials. The suppression effects on reaction
	times were stronger on prosaccade trials compared with antisaccade
	trials. The analysis of reaction time distributions using the linear
	approach to threshold with ergodic rate model (LATER model) revealed
	that microstimulation prolonged reaction times by reducing the rate
	of rise to the threshold for saccade initiation. Microstimulation
	also worsened correct performance rates for contralateral saccades.
	The same microstimulation prolonged and/or shortened the reaction
	times of ipsilateral saccades, although the effects were not as consistent

	are sufficient to suppress contralateral saccades and influence saccadic

	action preparation. Here, using the antisaccade paradigm (look away

	the oculomotor striatum, encoding predominantly automatic saccades
	toward the stimulus and volitional saccades in the opposite direction
	of the stimulus in monkeys. We found that before actual saccade directions
	were defined by visual stimulus appearance, neurons encoding volitional
	saccades increased activity with elapsed time from fixation initiation
	and by a temporal gap between fixation point disappearance and stimulus
	appearance. Their activity was further enhanced by an antisaccade
	instruction and correlated with antisaccade behavior. Neurons encoding
	automatic saccades also increased activity with elapsed time from
	fixation initiation and by a fixation gap. However, the activity
	of this type of neuron was not enhanced by an antisaccade instruction
	nor correlated with antisaccade behavior. We conclude that caudate
	neurons integrate nonspatial signals, such as elapsed time from fixation
	initiation, fixation gap, and task instructions, to preset BG circuits
	in favor of volitional actions to compete against automatic actions

  abstract = {A dominant basal ganglia (BG) model consists of two functionally opposite
	pathways: one facilitates motor output and the other suppresses it.
	Although this idea was originally proposed to account for motor deficits,
	it has been extended recently also to explain cognitive deficits.
	Here, we employed the antisaccade paradigm (look away from a stimulus)
	to address the role of the caudate nucleus, the main BG input stage
	where the two pathways diverge, in conflict resolution. Using single
	neuron recordings in awake monkeys, we identified the following three
	groups of neurons. The first group of neurons showed activity consistent
	with sensory-driven (automatic) saccades toward a contralateral visual
	stimulus. The second group of neurons showed activity consistent
	with internally driven (volitional) saccades toward the contralateral
	side regardless of stimulus locations. The third group of neurons
	showed similar firing characteristics with the second group of neurons,
	except that their preferred saccade direction was ipsilateral. The
	activity of the three groups of neurons was correlated with behavioral
	outcome. Based on these findings, we suggest the following hypothesis:
	the first and second groups of neurons encoding automatic and volitional
	saccades, respectively, might give rise to the facilitation (direct)
	pathway and promote saccades toward the opposite directions, which
	creates a response conflict. This conflict could be resolved by the
	third group of caudate neurons, which might give rise to the suppression
	(indirect) pathway and attenuate inappropriate saccade commands toward
	the stimulus.},

  abstract = {We review the contributions of biologically constrained computational
	models to our understanding of motor and cognitive deficits in Parkinson's
	disease (PD). The loss of dopaminergic neurons innervating the striatum
	in PD, and the well-established role of dopamine (DA) in reinforcement
	learning (RL), enable neural network models of the basal ganglia
	(BG) to derive concrete and testable predictions. We focus in this
	review on one simple underlying principle - the notion that reduced
	DA increases activity and causes long-term potentiation in the indirect
	pathway of the BG. We show how this theory can provide a unified
	account of diverse and seemingly unrelated phenomena in PD including
	progressive motor degeneration as well as cognitive deficits in RL,
	decision making and working memory. DA replacement therapy and deep
	brain stimulation can alleviate some aspects of these impairments,
	but can actually introduce negative effects such as motor dyskinesias
	and cognitive impulsivity. We discuss these treatment effects in
	terms of modulation of specific mechanisms within the computational
	framework. In addition, we review neurocomputational interpretations
	of increased impulsivity in the face of response conflict in patients
	with deep-brain-stimulation.},

	OBJECTIVES: The present study investigated the roles of the D1-like

	(DLS) on learning and performance of conditioned avoidance responses
	(CARs). METHODS: Adult male Wistar rats received intraperitoneal
	(i.p.), intra-NAc, or intra-DLS injections of the D1 dopamine receptor
	agonist SKF 81297 or the D1 receptor antagonist SCH 23390 20 min
	before or immediately after a training session in the CAR task two-way
	active avoidance, carried out 24 h before a test session. RESULTS:
	Pre-training administration of SCH 23390, but not SKF 81297, caused
	a significant decrease in the number of CARs in the test, but not
	in the training session, when injected into the DLS, or in either
	session when injected into the NAc. It also caused a significant
	increase in the number of escape failures in the training session
	when injected into the NAc. Systemic administration caused a combination
	of these effects. Post-training administrations of these drugs caused
	no significant effect. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the
	D1-like receptors in the NAc and DLS play important, though different,
	roles in learning and performance of CAR.},

	Two samples were studied. The first sample consisted of patients

	(DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN). The second sample consisted
	of patients who received DBS for the treatment of PD or essential
	tremor (ET) in the ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus (Vim).
	Stop-signal task and go/no-go task performances were studied in both
	groups. Both groups performed these tasks with (on stimulation) and
	without (off stimulation) DBS to address the question of whether
	stimulation is effective in improving choice reaction time (RT) and
	stop-signal RT. The results show that DBS of the STN was associated
	with significantly enhanced inhibitory control, as indicated by shorter
	stop-signal RTs. An additional finding is that DBS of the STN led
	to significantly shorter choice RT. The effects of DBS on responding
	and response inhibition were functionally independent. Although DBS
	of the Vim did not systematically affect task performance in patients
	with ET, a subgroup of Vim-stimulated PD patients showed enhanced
	stop-signal RTs in on stimulation versus off stimulation. This result
	suggests that the change in performance to stop signals may not be
	directly related to STN function, but rather results from a change
	in PD function due to DBS in general. The findings are discussed

	at the level of single neuron membranes, within local neuronal groups

	has shown that during theta states distant neuronal groups synchronize,
	forming networks of spatially confined neuronal clusters at specific
	time periods during task performance. Here, we show that a functional
	commonality of networks engaging in theta rhythmic states is that
	they emerge around decision points, reflecting rhythmic synchronization
	of choice-relevant information. Decision points characterize a point
	in time shortly before a subject chooses to select one action over
	another, i.e., when automatic behavior is terminated and the organism
	reactivates multiple sources of information to evaluate the evidence
	for available choices. As such, decision processes require the coordinated
	retrieval of choice-relevant information including (i) the retrieval
	of stimulus evaluations (stimulus-reward associations) and reward
	expectancies about future outcomes, (ii) the retrieval of past and
	prospective memories (e.g., stimulus-stimulus associations), (iii)
	the reactivation of contextual task rule representations (e.g., stimulus-response
	mappings), along with (iv) an ongoing assessment of sensory evidence.
	An increasing number of studies reveal that retrieval of these multiple
	types of information proceeds within few theta cycles through synchronized
	spiking activity across limbic, striatal, and cortical processing
	nodes. The outlined evidence suggests that evolving spatially and
	temporally specific theta synchronization could serve as the critical

	temporal accumulation, on a timescale of hundreds of milliseconds,
	of sensory evidence before a decision is reached. To elucidate the
	cellular and circuit basis of such integration times, we developed
	and investigated a simplified two-variable version of a biophysically
	realistic cortical network model of decision making. In this model,
	slow time integration can be achieved robustly if excitatory reverberation
	is primarily mediated by NMDA receptors; our model with only fast
	AMPA receptors at recurrent synapses produces decision times that
	are not comparable with experimental observations. Moreover, we found
	two distinct modes of network behavior, in which decision computation
	by winner-take-all competition is instantiated with or without attractor
	states for working memory. Decision process is closely linked to
	the local dynamics, in the "decision space" of the system, in the
	vicinity of an unstable saddle steady state that separates the basins
	of attraction for the two alternative choices. This picture provides
	a rigorous and quantitative explanation for the dependence of performance
	and response time on the degree of task difficulty, and the reason
	for which reaction times are longer in error trials than in correct
	trials as observed in the monkey experiment. Our reduced two-variable

	In a saccade-countermanding task, subjects are instructed that, if

	recordings in the frontal eye fields and superior colliculus of behaving

	the functioning of control mechanisms responsible for optimizing
	performance. We demonstrate, using computer simulations and mathematical
	analysis, that pre-target fixation neuronal activity supports countermanding
	behavior that maximizes reward rate as a function of the stop signal
	delay, fraction of stop signal trials, intertrial interval, duration
	of timeout, and relative reward value. We propose experiments to

  abstract = {Chaotic ecological dynamic systems defy conventional statistical analysis.
	Systems with near-chaotic dynamics are little better. Such systems
	are almost invariably driven by endogenous dynamic processes plus
	demographic and environmental process noise, and are only observable
	with error. Their sensitivity to history means that minute changes
	in the driving noise realization, or the system parameters, will
	cause drastic changes in the system trajectory. This sensitivity
	is inherited and amplified by the joint probability density of the
	observable data and the process noise, rendering it useless as the
	basis for obtaining measures of statistical fit. Because the joint
	density is the basis for the fit measures used by all conventional
	statistical methods, this is a major theoretical shortcoming. The
	inability to make well-founded statistical inferences about biological
	dynamic models in the chaotic and near-chaotic regimes, other than
	on an ad hoc basis, leaves dynamic theory without the methods of
	quantitative validation that are essential tools in the rest of biological
	science. Here I show that this impasse can be resolved in a simple
	and general manner, using a method that requires only the ability
	to simulate the observed data on a system from the dynamic model
	about which inferences are required. The raw data series are reduced
	to phase-insensitive summary statistics, quantifying local dynamic

  abstract = {Multichannel electroencephalography (EEG) offers a non-invasive tool
	to explore spatio-temporal dynamics of brain activity. With EEG recordings
	consisting of multiple trials, traditional signal processing approaches
	that ignore inter-trial variability in the data may fail to accurately
	estimate the underlying spatio-temporal brain patterns. Moreover,
	precise characterization of such inter-trial variability per se can
	be of high scientific value in establishing the relationship between
	brain activity and behavior. In this paper, a statistical modeling
	framework is introduced for learning spatio-temporal decompositions
	of multiple-trial EEG data recorded under two contrasting experimental
	conditions. By modeling the variance of source signals as random
	variables varying across trials, the proposed two-stage hierarchical
	Bayesian model is able to capture inter-trial amplitude variability
	in the data in a sparse way where a parsimonious representation of
	the data can be obtained. A variational Bayesian (VB) algorithm is
	developed for statistical inference of the hierarchical model. The
	efficacy of the proposed modeling framework is validated with the
	analysis of both synthetic and real EEG data. In the simulation study
	we show that even at low signal-to-noise ratios our approach is able
	to recover with high precision the underlying spatio-temporal patterns
	and the dynamics of source amplitude across trials; on two brain-computer
	interface (BCI) data sets we show that our VB algorithm can extract
	physiologically meaningful spatio-temporal patterns and make more
	accurate predictions than other two widely used algorithms: the common
	spatial patterns (CSP) algorithm and the Infomax algorithm for independent
	component analysis (ICA). The results demonstrate that our statistical
	modeling framework can serve as a powerful tool for extracting brain
	patterns, characterizing trial-to-trial brain dynamics, and decoding
	brain states by exploiting useful structures in the data.},

	controls without Parkinson's disease (n = 17) on performance in a

	We applied distributional analytic methods to separate the strength
	of the initial response impulse from the proficiency of inhibitory
	control engaged subsequently to suppress the impulse. Patients with
	Parkinson's disease were tested when stimulation was either turned
	on or off. Mean conflict interference effects did not differ between
	controls and patients, or within patients when stimulation was on
	versus off. In contrast, distributional analyses revealed two dissociable
	effects of subthalamic nucleus stimulation. Fast response errors
	indicated that stimulation increased impulsive, premature responding
	in high conflict situations. Later in the reaction process, however,
	stimulation improved the proficiency with which inhibitory control
	was engaged to suppress these impulses selectively, thereby facilitating
	selection of the correct action. This temporal dissociation supports
	a conceptual framework for resolving past paradoxical findings and
	further highlights that dynamic aspects of impulse and inhibitory
	control underlying goal-directed behaviour rely in part on neural
	circuitry inclusive of the subthalamic nucleus.},

	for patients with PD to suppress interference arising from the automatic
	activation of salient or overlearned responses. Empirical observations
	thus far have confirmed this assumption in some studies, but not
	in others, due presumably to considerable inter-individual variability
	among PD patients. In an attempt to help resolve this controversy,
	we measured the performance of 50 PD patients and 25 healthy controls
	on an arrow version of the Eriksen flanker task in which participants
	were required to select a response based on the direction of a target

	reaction time (RT) increased with incongruent flankers compared to
	congruent or neutral flankers, and this cost of incongruence was

	distributional analyses, guided by dual-process models of conflict
	effects and the activation-suppression hypothesis, revealed that
	PD patients are less efficient at suppressing the activation of conflicting
	responses, even when matched to healthy controls on RT in a neutral
	condition. Second, this reduced efficiency was apparent in half of

	Mild perturbations in network connectivity resulted in the spontaneous

	within the network without external changes in behavior, correlating
	to the fictive sensations and agency experienced by episodic disease
	patients. In contrast, more severe deficits resulted in unstable

	pallidus (GP) is involved in the generation of antisaccades. To understand
	the roles of the GP, we examined single neuron activity and the effects
	of local inactivation. Monkeys were trained to make either a pro-
	or antisaccade according to prior instruction provided by the color
	of the fixation point in each trial. Among 119 saccade-related neurons,
	55\% showed increased firing rates associated with saccades, whereas
	the remaining neurons showed decreased firing rates. For both populations
	of neurons, the activity modulation was enhanced during the preparation
	and execution of antisaccades, as compared with prosaccades. Inactivation
	of the recording sites in the external segment of the GP resulted
	in an increase in the number of error trials in the antisaccade tasks,
	suggesting that signals in the GP may play roles in suppressing inadequate
	prosaccades in the task. Signals in the GP might regulate eye movements

	saccades. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus
	(STN) is widely used as a treatment of Parkinson disease (PD) by
	altering the function of the BG. Nevertheless, the effects of STN
	DBS on saccade performance are not fully clarified in a systematic
	manner. In this study, we examined the effects of bilateral STN DBS
	on both the initiation and inhibition of saccades in PD. METHODS:
	Thirty-two patients with PD performed 4 oculomotor tasks. Two tasks
	(visually guided saccades and gap saccades) were reflexive and 2
	(memory-guided saccades MGS and antisaccades) were volitional. While
	taking their regular doses of antiparkinsonian drugs, patients performed
	these tasks under 2 conditions: during DBS (DBS-on condition) and
	without DBS (DBS-off condition). Fifty-one age-matched subjects served
	as controls. RESULTS: In the DBS-on condition, parameters of saccade
	initiation were improved in all tasks, with shorter latencies and
	increased amplitudes, except for MGS latency. STN DBS improved the
	ability to suppress unwanted saccades to the cue stimulus in the
	MGS task. However, it did not suppress prosaccades during the antisaccade
	task. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that deep brain stimulation
	(DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) affects the neural pathway
	common to both reflexive and volitional saccades, possibly by acting
	on the STN-substantia nigra pars reticulata-superior colliculi pathway.
	STN DBS may set the functional level of the superior colliculi appropriate
	for both saccade initiation and inhibition through this pathway.
	These findings provide novel insights into the pathophysiology of
	Parkinson disease and may yield better treatment strategies.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inhibitory control is central to executive functioning
	and appears deficient in schizophrenia. However, it is unclear how
	inhibitory control is affected, what the underlying neural mechanisms
	are, whether these deficits are related to the illness itself or
	to increased risk for the illness, and whether there is a relation
	to impairments in other executive functions. METHODS: We used functional
	magnetic resonance imaging to investigate two forms of inhibitory
	control: proactive inhibition (anticipation of stopping) and reactive
	inhibition (outright stopping). Twenty-four schizophrenia patients,
	24 unaffected siblings, and 24 healthy control subjects performed
	a modified version of the stop-signal paradigm. To assess the relation
	between performance on inhibitory control and other executive functions,
	we correlated inhibitory control indices with working memory span.
	RESULTS: Compared with control subjects, proactive inhibition was
	reduced in patients and siblings. Reactive inhibition was unaffected.
	Reduced proactive inhibition was associated with a failure to activate
	the right striatum, the right inferior frontal cortex, and the left
	and right temporoparietal junction. Activation during reactive inhibition
	was unaffected. Those patients with the least proactive inhibition
	also showed the shortest working memory span. CONCLUSIONS: These
	results suggest that schizophrenia is associated with reduced proactive
	inhibition, probably resulting from corticostriatal dysfunction.
	This deficit is related to an increased risk for schizophrenia and
	likely reflects a general executive function deficit rather than
	a specific inhibitory control impairment.},
